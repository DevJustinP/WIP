4bc30e61-8b90-4b83-91db-d23de6ead86e-0
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.703
Ran at the last minute. It
happens. No worries. I

4bc30e61-8b90-4b83-91db-d23de6ead86e-1
00:00:06.703 --> 00:00:11.998
appreciate it. So I have been
given a rock this quarter for

4bc30e61-8b90-4b83-91db-d23de6ead86e-2
00:00:11.998 --> 00:00:17.294
marketing Swatch fulfillment
requirements and that's pretty

4bc30e61-8b90-4b83-91db-d23de6ead86e-3
00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:23.031
much what I have. I don't really
have any additional information

4bc30e61-8b90-4b83-91db-d23de6ead86e-4
00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:28.680
outside of basically what I put
in the the meeting invite. Umm.

4bc30e61-8b90-4b83-91db-d23de6ead86e-5
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.740
And so I am hoping that you can
give me some.

efbda7b1-3cdd-4b0b-a95c-3e2e0f5bcba7-0
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.009
Background. I have not been
given an IT ticket for this.

efbda7b1-3cdd-4b0b-a95c-3e2e0f5bcba7-1
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.830
Have you?

da913e37-60db-4927-a52d-9acbf678af16-0
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.310
Filled out a ticket.

97b1d2d1-2bf2-4a7a-83ff-ce5a0973954b-0
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.620
There were a few IT tickets put
into the system a while back.

076fc52d-bae7-4dba-ba77-8eb283c12c4f-0
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.020
To upgrade the marketing
fulfillment warehouse in order

076fc52d-bae7-4dba-ba77-8eb283c12c4f-1
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.716
to be able to be incorporated
into the website for the memo

076fc52d-bae7-4dba-ba77-8eb283c12c4f-2
00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:10.859
Swatch requests, but it's also
the entire warehouse needs to be

076fc52d-bae7-4dba-ba77-8eb283c12c4f-3
00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:12.980
upgraded in syspro.

9a14a94a-25f7-488e-baf0-f57cb569c33e-0
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.610
Into um.

0b583705-a92e-4c0d-962d-d4c3c9d3cf88-0
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.720
Oh what? What's it called?

5e4e2068-6ae3-427c-8dcd-2174fe0d4191-0
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.410
I don't know what it's called.

2633c076-ba04-46c2-8bf2-5f6b8077ce4e-0
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.130
Um, but basically our syspro
system is the old.

ae72aef0-9d6d-48ee-8f6f-a4c1c9c49f39-0
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.601
And analog kind of a deal where
everything is very manual, very

ae72aef0-9d6d-48ee-8f6f-a4c1c9c49f39-1
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:45.194
everything is very physical kind
of a deal. We don't have been

ae72aef0-9d6d-48ee-8f6f-a4c1c9c49f39-2
00:01:45.194 --> 00:01:50.255
locations or allocations, we
don't have barcodes for our

ae72aef0-9d6d-48ee-8f6f-a4c1c9c49f39-3
00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:56.025
separate items and that sort of
thing and it's we need to be put

ae72aef0-9d6d-48ee-8f6f-a4c1c9c49f39-4
00:01:56.025 --> 00:02:00.820
into the system just like the
distribution warehouse.

a4fde5b0-6f5a-4675-9f8b-27dbc1012c4e-0
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.790
Upgraded to that system. I know
it's.

afc2372e-7d91-44b2-a9c0-4b3fdbf40d48-0
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.720
What is it called?

6ba4aafb-e254-431b-89b4-eba9d5753d6e-0
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.460
Unfortunately I can't help you
there. I'm pretty new to um to

6ba4aafb-e254-431b-89b4-eba9d5753d6e-1
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.070
SC. I've only been here.

16862c90-cff4-4692-82a3-143737bdc6b5-0
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.140
Now.

72169d0f-23ee-4363-aa7f-99cb5b1baaf2-0
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.120
A handful of months.

c9bf6baa-eea3-46e0-9acc-382a926c7829-0
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.264
Time flies, but it's still
everything is still very new to

c9bf6baa-eea3-46e0-9acc-382a926c7829-1
00:02:26.264 --> 00:02:26.490
me.

355c2c9a-3ada-423f-af7c-f2eb0e9c6ae7-0
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.498
So I am not even abreast of the
old tickets. So if you could

355c2c9a-3ada-423f-af7c-f2eb0e9c6ae7-1
00:02:33.498 --> 00:02:38.661
pass me along those ticket
numbers that you have so that I

355c2c9a-3ada-423f-af7c-f2eb0e9c6ae7-2
00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:43.912
could try to look at them if
possible or try and find them,

355c2c9a-3ada-423f-af7c-f2eb0e9c6ae7-3
00:02:43.912 --> 00:02:44.350
yeah.

d96d46a4-6ad5-4963-830f-21d60a56a4e3-0
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.476
OK, let me write that down. I
don't know if I can find it

d96d46a4-6ad5-4963-830f-21d60a56a4e3-1
00:02:49.476 --> 00:02:53.540
while I'm in this meeting,
though. That makes sense.

ced7e882-83a9-4f81-9f00-5569a5614944-0
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.987
So really, what this meeting,
what this meeting is about and

ced7e882-83a9-4f81-9f00-5569a5614944-1
00:02:58.987 --> 00:03:03.255
what I do as a DBA, I'm not sure
if you've ever worked with one

ced7e882-83a9-4f81-9f00-5569a5614944-2
00:03:03.255 --> 00:03:07.456
before, but I will gather the
requirements and put them into a

ced7e882-83a9-4f81-9f00-5569a5614944-3
00:03:07.456 --> 00:03:11.657
requirements document to ensure
that everything that is passed

ced7e882-83a9-4f81-9f00-5569a5614944-4
00:03:11.657 --> 00:03:15.524
off to IT development is what
you need to meet either the

ced7e882-83a9-4f81-9f00-5569a5614944-5
00:03:15.524 --> 00:03:18.791
entire project or this
particular portion of the

ced7e882-83a9-4f81-9f00-5569a5614944-6
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:22.792
project. This is not something
that will be done all in one

ced7e882-83a9-4f81-9f00-5569a5614944-7
00:03:22.792 --> 00:03:25.060
quarter. Typically I'll take
1/4.

790a8896-c2db-44c2-856e-7a332178a6a1-0
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.869
To get the requirements
documented that may include

790a8896-c2db-44c2-856e-7a332178a6a1-1
00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:32.968
screenshots or videos etcetera
of whatever the issue is,

790a8896-c2db-44c2-856e-7a332178a6a1-2
00:03:32.968 --> 00:03:37.499
whether it's an enhancement, a
problem that needs to be solved

790a8896-c2db-44c2-856e-7a332178a6a1-3
00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:41.382
or if if it is new I'm
development work that needs to

790a8896-c2db-44c2-856e-7a332178a6a1-4
00:03:41.382 --> 00:03:45.481
be done. And then in the
following quarter what tends to

790a8896-c2db-44c2-856e-7a332178a6a1-5
00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:50.228
happen is once you've signed off
on the documentation then I pass

790a8896-c2db-44c2-856e-7a332178a6a1-6
00:03:50.228 --> 00:03:54.111
it over to IT development bin
and catheter, we have a

790a8896-c2db-44c2-856e-7a332178a6a1-7
00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:55.550
discussion about it.

13a741c6-a6e3-4d7e-b1cb-67cc79e42e5c-0
00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.068
Tend to bring you in into one or
two or multiple meetings and

13a741c6-a6e3-4d7e-b1cb-67cc79e42e5c-1
00:04:00.068 --> 00:04:03.648
make sure that everybody
understands what's being

13a741c6-a6e3-4d7e-b1cb-67cc79e42e5c-2
00:04:03.648 --> 00:04:07.370
requested and then it
development will schedule the

13a741c6-a6e3-4d7e-b1cb-67cc79e42e5c-3
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.523
actual work to be done. So I
know that that is a bit of a

13a741c6-a6e3-4d7e-b1cb-67cc79e42e5c-4
00:04:11.523 --> 00:04:16.033
different process than what has
been done in the past. So kind

13a741c6-a6e3-4d7e-b1cb-67cc79e42e5c-5
00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:20.257
of what I do in this initial
meeting is get you to tell me

13a741c6-a6e3-4d7e-b1cb-67cc79e42e5c-6
00:04:20.257 --> 00:04:24.696
the background of in this case
it sounds almost like it's not

13a741c6-a6e3-4d7e-b1cb-67cc79e42e5c-7
00:04:24.696 --> 00:04:25.769
an enhancement.

b13615b1-783c-4b42-8595-651d41dcf48a-0
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.456
Well, but maybe it sounds like
you're already doing something

b13615b1-783c-4b42-8595-651d41dcf48a-1
00:04:31.456 --> 00:04:36.510
and it needs, is this automation
or is it that it just needs to

b13615b1-783c-4b42-8595-651d41dcf48a-2
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.090
mirror distribution?

7da48226-9d57-4ae9-b0c5-d7aa705e91c0-0
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.610
Umm.

ea69ccdc-c812-4cc0-baf5-d2f848300b6b-0
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.252
A little bit of both. I think
it's a little bit of both. So it

ea69ccdc-c812-4cc0-baf5-d2f848300b6b-1
00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:52.393
is definitely in enhancement
because it will definitely

ea69ccdc-c812-4cc0-baf5-d2f848300b6b-2
00:04:52.393 --> 00:04:56.340
upgrade our system and make it a
lot more.

45e843fe-82d5-4ae1-8dca-4344f8d15447-0
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.080
Flowable I guess is a a good way
to put it. Um.

7e275d5b-0da6-4406-8da7-d194b9891156-0
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.697
Instead of having everything to
be done individually and

7e275d5b-0da6-4406-8da7-d194b9891156-1
00:05:07.697 --> 00:05:12.229
manually, like putting in
inventory into the system, right

7e275d5b-0da6-4406-8da7-d194b9891156-2
00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.760
now we have to do that very
manually. And instead of being

7e275d5b-0da6-4406-8da7-d194b9891156-3
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.599
able to like say for instance,
the distribution center, when a

7e275d5b-0da6-4406-8da7-d194b9891156-4
00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.207
truck comes in, they can scan
all of the items and then put

7e275d5b-0da6-4406-8da7-d194b9891156-5
00:05:26.207 --> 00:05:31.046
them into specific bins and that
will automatically update the

7e275d5b-0da6-4406-8da7-d194b9891156-6
00:05:31.046 --> 00:05:34.809
inventory to say, oh hey, we
just got 10 chairs.

69044568-09d7-4e35-b941-ea429f7665dd-0
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:43.280
Off of the truck and they are
now in the system under B1O3.

4c8b5367-1291-45a0-a5e4-7b2469fac39b-0
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.046
OK, alright. So can you walk me
through because I have not seen

4c8b5367-1291-45a0-a5e4-7b2469fac39b-1
00:05:50.046 --> 00:05:55.022
the tickets. Can you tell me
what is the main issue that

4c8b5367-1291-45a0-a5e4-7b2469fac39b-2
00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:57.990
brought up even this rock for
me?

03338090-5d20-4820-a9fd-32be747468b2-0
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.770
What? What, man? There are two,
actually.

d57acf35-2322-4c85-9e26-3ea8919c3bea-0
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.544
Being able to follow the ticket
process from order entry, order

d57acf35-2322-4c85-9e26-3ea8919c3bea-1
00:06:10.544 --> 00:06:15.260
receipt, or order received order
entry.

864bd7a6-1102-4d8c-8587-07752dfe1c52-0
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.246
Order printed and in the
warehouse to order completed and

864bd7a6-1102-4d8c-8587-07752dfe1c52-1
00:06:22.246 --> 00:06:27.608
shipped to order invoiced, being
able to actually follow that

864bd7a6-1102-4d8c-8587-07752dfe1c52-2
00:06:27.608 --> 00:06:32.278
path from a customer's
standpoint and from a customer

864bd7a6-1102-4d8c-8587-07752dfe1c52-3
00:06:32.278 --> 00:06:37.554
service standpoint, Umm, we
definitely need that. So what do

864bd7a6-1102-4d8c-8587-07752dfe1c52-4
00:06:37.554 --> 00:06:41.360
you mean by following define
follow for me?

66c6f059-7525-4954-9d08-ca9fd8f646a7-0
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.030
Where when you look in into an
order.

863999ce-4a30-4898-b0fd-8d06f1b683d0-0
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.213
For say distribution, you can
tell that so and so has that

863999ce-4a30-4898-b0fd-8d06f1b683d0-1
00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:59.163
order. It has been printed and
they are in the process of

863999ce-4a30-4898-b0fd-8d06f1b683d0-2
00:06:59.163 --> 00:07:05.730
picking it. And you can actually
see when each item gets pulled

863999ce-4a30-4898-b0fd-8d06f1b683d0-3
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:11.885
and then it also changes the
status like status 1234, so on

863999ce-4a30-4898-b0fd-8d06f1b683d0-4
00:07:11.885 --> 00:07:13.630
and so forth 8-9.

eb5e0331-2d82-4e5e-aafb-b7406e79894a-0
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.301
When it is actually scanned onto
the truck and loaded onto the

eb5e0331-2d82-4e5e-aafb-b7406e79894a-1
00:07:19.301 --> 00:07:23.123
truck and completed on our end,
it is scanned and you can

eb5e0331-2d82-4e5e-aafb-b7406e79894a-2
00:07:23.123 --> 00:07:27.208
actually see that status will
automatically change and update

eb5e0331-2d82-4e5e-aafb-b7406e79894a-3
00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:29.909
instead of being in the
warehouse it is.

0e6d735a-7c15-4db9-a07b-a85af640cc42-0
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.070
Um, shipped.

89221459-6043-41f0-9b58-805fc2660e1c-0
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.822
So this is in syspro. Syspro.
Yes ma'am. OK, and how? How do

89221459-6043-41f0-9b58-805fc2660e1c-1
00:07:38.822 --> 00:07:44.083
you currently know the stages
that a Swatch is in? So

89221459-6043-41f0-9b58-805fc2660e1c-2
00:07:44.083 --> 00:07:50.123
currently you don't. There is
only status one, status for and

89221459-6043-41f0-9b58-805fc2660e1c-3
00:07:50.123 --> 00:07:51.000
status 9.

04c943d8-01bf-4060-a71c-8f2af00a6f0b-0
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:57.072
As of right, how are you? How
are you notified when it goes

04c943d8-01bf-4060-a71c-8f2af00a6f0b-1
00:07:57.072 --> 00:07:59.150
from status 1 to 4 to 9?

45d0b4da-aa75-482d-812a-b2f42de15228-0
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.694
Status one to four when I
personally or a member of my

45d0b4da-aa75-482d-812a-b2f42de15228-1
00:08:04.694 --> 00:08:06.680
team print the pick ticket.

91c23bae-79f9-423b-b6be-8a6116dd8c24-0
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:13.442
And then it goes to 9 after we
have completed it and shipped it

91c23bae-79f9-423b-b6be-8a6116dd8c24-1
00:08:13.442 --> 00:08:17.960
and we take it to accounting and
Miss Ellen invoices it.

5e14d2fe-9966-4a34-987d-4a37b79a9959-0
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.944
So when you say take to
accounting, do you mean

5e14d2fe-9966-4a34-987d-4a37b79a9959-1
00:08:23.944 --> 00:08:27.833
physically or do you mean
e-mail? OK, yes, physically.

5e14d2fe-9966-4a34-987d-4a37b79a9959-2
00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:29.460
Take a stack of papers.

865128d4-ebca-4326-8f4a-a95b02af1fc3-0
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:35.950
For the day to her so that she
physically types in each order.

814765b3-7d09-40f3-be86-6d84b60703af-0
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:42.359
And changes the status from
status 4 to status 8 and

814765b3-7d09-40f3-be86-6d84b60703af-1
00:08:42.359 --> 00:08:43.980
invoices it out.

078a90f0-1511-4c23-be55-20ee81ce8190-0
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:53.436
She's changing insist bro from
status 4 to to 8 or 9 to 8-9 to

078a90f0-1511-4c23-be55-20ee81ce8190-1
00:08:53.436 --> 00:08:53.640
9.

fe80d4f8-4fd4-45f0-9bcd-597a45421d2c-0
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.936
Yeah, if there is an issue with
it and she's not able to

fe80d4f8-4fd4-45f0-9bcd-597a45421d2c-1
00:08:57.936 --> 00:09:01.103
completely close it out, she
does change it to status 8.

fe80d4f8-4fd4-45f0-9bcd-597a45421d2c-2
00:09:01.103 --> 00:09:04.381
We're just. I'm not 100% sure
what the actual verbiage for

fe80d4f8-4fd4-45f0-9bcd-597a45421d2c-3
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:07.160
status 8 is, but I think it's
just in accounting.

fb04a5d7-1cd8-4f2c-bef5-f93b1fefb314-0
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.121
And so and then does she. So
when you look at this throne,

fb04a5d7-1cd8-4f2c-bef5-f93b1fefb314-1
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:16.137
you see that it is now at 9 from
4 then you know that that then

fb04a5d7-1cd8-4f2c-bef5-f93b1fefb314-2
00:09:16.137 --> 00:09:20.026
has been fulfilled and it is, it
is gone out to the customers

fb04a5d7-1cd8-4f2c-bef5-f93b1fefb314-3
00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:23.791
that. Correct right. And it is
complete. Yes, ma'am. OK. So

fb04a5d7-1cd8-4f2c-bef5-f93b1fefb314-4
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:27.618
then when you say that you want
to be able to follow, you're

fb04a5d7-1cd8-4f2c-bef5-f93b1fefb314-5
00:09:27.618 --> 00:09:29.940
looking at what screen is this,
bro?

74fb4278-4be5-4d8a-80d9-d219826d727d-0
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.010
Um.

4cf3d4d8-f727-4c87-83fd-ce4715d61b28-0
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.550
Order maintenance.

8246d552-a891-454a-be5f-2df9cb719bd7-0
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.604
So where within order
maintenance would you like to

8246d552-a891-454a-be5f-2df9cb719bd7-1
00:09:39.604 --> 00:09:40.510
see updates?

cc7d46d9-5caa-497a-b777-4ac8ea449768-0
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.320
Or is it that you would like to
receive automated emails?

4d7f35fb-8623-43e8-9731-bd1492927577-0
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.267
Or some combination of the two.
What would be considered a

4d7f35fb-8623-43e8-9731-bd1492927577-1
00:09:51.267 --> 00:09:55.546
solution for you? A combination
of the two because a lot of

4d7f35fb-8623-43e8-9731-bd1492927577-2
00:09:55.546 --> 00:10:00.040
times it is an actual customers
account that has ordered a set

4d7f35fb-8623-43e8-9731-bd1492927577-3
00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.176
of swatches, a catalog or
something along those lines and

4d7f35fb-8623-43e8-9731-bd1492927577-4
00:10:04.176 --> 00:10:08.313
them receiving an e-mail of hey
your order has been is in

4d7f35fb-8623-43e8-9731-bd1492927577-5
00:10:08.313 --> 00:10:12.663
process of being packaged and
shipped and then receiving the

4d7f35fb-8623-43e8-9731-bd1492927577-6
00:10:12.663 --> 00:10:16.799
e-mail of hey it is shipped.
Here's your tracking number.

29b6ac39-8584-4a5f-9dce-218681a9c2b2-0
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.790
And so these are external emails
that you are like, yes.

f6d3c244-c818-442f-a135-989b8e324439-0
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.550
So external to the customer.

7c026e28-3ee2-449d-81ce-49b4202d83ef-0
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:29.751
And then within Syspro you would
like it to automatically update

7c026e28-3ee2-449d-81ce-49b4202d83ef-1
00:10:29.751 --> 00:10:33.848
as it is going through the
process without the manual

7c026e28-3ee2-449d-81ce-49b4202d83ef-2
00:10:33.848 --> 00:10:38.780
intervention. So can you tell me
exactly what the steps are that

7c026e28-3ee2-449d-81ce-49b4202d83ef-3
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.484
you would like to have updated
within syspro? So for instance

7c026e28-3ee2-449d-81ce-49b4202d83ef-4
00:10:43.484 --> 00:10:48.264
when the order is received and
syspro in the order maintenance

7c026e28-3ee2-449d-81ce-49b4202d83ef-5
00:10:48.264 --> 00:10:50.920
screen you would like to see
what?

42e9d119-0be4-4975-b932-7615e3b13a53-0
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:57.727
Um so right now for that
particular leg of the journey it

42e9d119-0be4-4975-b932-7615e3b13a53-1
00:10:57.727 --> 00:11:04.120
is OK. I have a report in access
customer service that I can type

42e9d119-0be4-4975-b932-7615e3b13a53-2
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:10.319
in and put in like I want to see
all the status one orders from

42e9d119-0be4-4975-b932-7615e3b13a53-3
00:11:10.319 --> 00:11:16.131
the MKT warehouse and it it will
pull up it will generate a

42e9d119-0be4-4975-b932-7615e3b13a53-4
00:11:16.131 --> 00:11:22.040
report. So as soon as it has
gone through order entry I get.

7fdcefb6-9a01-41ca-8663-384a1ead65ea-0
00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.220
Visualization on it.

12f7f247-778d-497e-9c4f-4d2b8562cef5-0
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.980
And then I go into Step 2, order
entry is received step one.

b6e5f55a-4e5e-4505-a053-7bbf93d41502-0
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.820
What are? What are? What are
these steps?

69a68972-9817-485c-a405-ddc1be1b90b1-0
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:38.352
So the actual steps are the life
of a request from from marketing

69a68972-9817-485c-a405-ddc1be1b90b1-1
00:11:38.352 --> 00:11:42.994
fulfillment is that a either a
customer or dealer or sales Rep

69a68972-9817-485c-a405-ddc1be1b90b1-2
00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:44.100
goes into ecat?

b67a6994-73c4-40ec-835c-cfbd55b82b99-0
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.954
And places in order and then
submits it. Slash confirm

b67a6994-73c4-40ec-835c-cfbd55b82b99-1
00:11:49.954 --> 00:11:55.716
confirms it and then it goes to
order entry over in customer

b67a6994-73c4-40ec-835c-cfbd55b82b99-2
00:11:55.716 --> 00:11:56.850
service. So.

17d6cb8d-4fdd-4b93-b5aa-6c1ec271a112-0
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:04.473
And what happens at order entry
and customers order, order

17d6cb8d-4fdd-4b93-b5aa-6c1ec271a112-1
00:12:04.473 --> 00:12:09.944
writing and then order received
and then order entry updates it

17d6cb8d-4fdd-4b93-b5aa-6c1ec271a112-2
00:12:09.944 --> 00:12:15.158
from just a confirmed order?
Umm, and I'm not sure what they

17d6cb8d-4fdd-4b93-b5aa-6c1ec271a112-3
00:12:15.158 --> 00:12:20.800
actually call it. You'll have to
actually ask one of the customer

17d6cb8d-4fdd-4b93-b5aa-6c1ec271a112-4
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.929
service order entry associates
what it is that they do, but

17d6cb8d-4fdd-4b93-b5aa-6c1ec271a112-5
00:12:25.929 --> 00:12:27.810
they switch it from a.

1e66e892-6983-4784-bd6b-30c5efe9d323-0
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.606
Hypothetical order into a
physical actual order, and it

1e66e892-6983-4784-bd6b-30c5efe9d323-1
00:12:32.606 --> 00:12:33.560
receives the.

ac86c97d-8ab0-4666-9d5f-5c383eef249a-0
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:39.939
The order number like the 200
dash blah blah blah blah or 220

ac86c97d-8ab0-4666-9d5f-5c383eef249a-1
00:12:39.939 --> 00:12:44.553
dash blah and that so they
change it from the reference

ac86c97d-8ab0-4666-9d5f-5c383eef249a-2
00:12:44.553 --> 00:12:49.498
number to an actual physical
order number. And where do you

ac86c97d-8ab0-4666-9d5f-5c383eef249a-3
00:12:49.498 --> 00:12:50.240
see that?

1e41a6fd-1659-47df-a8b4-af36d8665a60-0
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:55.364
I don't see that particular part
of it. I don't get the reference

1e41a6fd-1659-47df-a8b4-af36d8665a60-1
00:12:55.364 --> 00:12:58.898
numbers and I can't look up
reference numbers. Personally, I

1e41a6fd-1659-47df-a8b4-af36d8665a60-2
00:12:58.898 --> 00:13:02.664
can only look up order numbers.
Would you like to be able to see

1e41a6fd-1659-47df-a8b4-af36d8665a60-3
00:13:02.664 --> 00:13:03.649
it at that point?

1f870282-ab19-46d2-827f-3ccf7188feb7-0
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:12.184
Honestly, I'm not 100% sure if
it's necessary for me to see it

1f870282-ab19-46d2-827f-3ccf7188feb7-1
00:13:12.184 --> 00:13:16.175
as a like a hypothetical 1,
because if it was a reference

1f870282-ab19-46d2-827f-3ccf7188feb7-2
00:13:16.175 --> 00:13:20.509
number and it wasn't like a full
physical order, I wouldn't be

1f870282-ab19-46d2-827f-3ccf7188feb7-3
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:24.913
able to print it. I wouldn't. I
wouldn't be able to do anything

1f870282-ab19-46d2-827f-3ccf7188feb7-4
00:13:24.913 --> 00:13:28.560
with it. So this is prior to it
coming to your team.

b589f4b8-743e-47bc-bf40-f37a2fd3ccc2-0
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:34.117
Right, right. OK. All right. So
then once it goes through order

b589f4b8-743e-47bc-bf40-f37a2fd3ccc2-1
00:13:34.117 --> 00:13:38.781
entry and customer service, then
the next step is then it is a

b589f4b8-743e-47bc-bf40-f37a2fd3ccc2-2
00:13:38.781 --> 00:13:40.040
status one order.

6e3e2156-6c9c-48f8-bb51-934db9a1a039-0
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.870
Is on my report.

2cfd6e19-73ce-4db6-8335-0689333dcf59-0
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.490
And then I go through and I
release the necessary inventory.

71501379-5691-4a78-97d7-ae155d9ee5ef-0
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.260
Umm, you're nice.

d9730c59-abd6-4839-8fd0-e7c23449af98-0
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:56.110
There in Syspro back order
release and then release

d9730c59-abd6-4839-8fd0-e7c23449af98-1
00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:00.930
reserved inventory. OK. So we
have to do those two steps.

3fef6a20-345c-4d22-8a92-9f6661336979-0
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.412
And then we go into order
maintenance and we put in each

3fef6a20-345c-4d22-8a92-9f6661336979-1
00:14:05.412 --> 00:14:09.736
individual order number one at a
time. Obviously double check to

3fef6a20-345c-4d22-8a92-9f6661336979-2
00:14:09.736 --> 00:14:12.730
make sure that everything on
that order has.

9f269af0-a6ac-4b30-8b2b-f02a3363191f-0
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.337
The same number of order
quantities as to ship

9f269af0-a6ac-4b30-8b2b-f02a3363191f-1
00:14:16.337 --> 00:14:20.275
quantities. Make sure that those
those match up and everything

9f269af0-a6ac-4b30-8b2b-f02a3363191f-2
00:14:20.275 --> 00:14:24.088
looks good on the order and if
it needs money that it's been

9f269af0-a6ac-4b30-8b2b-f02a3363191f-3
00:14:24.088 --> 00:14:27.651
paid for, if it hasn't been paid
for, we send it back to

9f269af0-a6ac-4b30-8b2b-f02a3363191f-4
00:14:27.651 --> 00:14:31.776
accounting and say, hey, can you
go ahead and charge this account

9f269af0-a6ac-4b30-8b2b-f02a3363191f-5
00:14:31.776 --> 00:14:35.651
for whatever it is because we
only have like a few items that

9f269af0-a6ac-4b30-8b2b-f02a3363191f-6
00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:39.464
actually cost money. Pretty much
all of our items don't cost

9f269af0-a6ac-4b30-8b2b-f02a3363191f-7
00:14:39.464 --> 00:14:43.339
money like a catalog is free. A
full set of swatches however,

9f269af0-a6ac-4b30-8b2b-f02a3363191f-8
00:14:43.339 --> 00:14:44.090
can be $850.

97ab07fa-3964-49b5-9bb0-527c645ec7a0-0
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.210
$3000 to.

da44168b-d7e6-4385-90b9-a098a73bc364-0
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.860
However much and sometimes the
customer actually does get them

da44168b-d7e6-4385-90b9-a098a73bc364-1
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.782
for free if they have qualified
for a free set. So it's kind of

da44168b-d7e6-4385-90b9-a098a73bc364-2
00:14:53.782 --> 00:14:55.560
like making sure that that's.

d78149ba-73fb-4e84-8662-ae895589c0ea-0
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.770
Buttoned up nice and neat.

d566ffa7-507d-466b-ae89-b9881c37360e-0
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:03.118
Um, and then after, you know, we
make sure everything's good to

d566ffa7-507d-466b-ae89-b9881c37360e-1
00:15:03.118 --> 00:15:07.485
go, we hit end order and then
print and then print and then

d566ffa7-507d-466b-ae89-b9881c37360e-2
00:15:07.485 --> 00:15:12.071
print a couple of times because
it asks you like three or four

d566ffa7-507d-466b-ae89-b9881c37360e-3
00:15:12.071 --> 00:15:16.584
times. Are you sure you want to
print this order? So we print

d566ffa7-507d-466b-ae89-b9881c37360e-4
00:15:16.584 --> 00:15:19.350
the order and then it is in
status 4.

9b27a4f0-44b3-4121-9eb9-d97e0e150e06-0
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:25.140
And then one of my team takes
the physical paper order.

0dedbef7-da0e-4685-bb20-b78cacadda50-0
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.630
Umm.

d5bf9fd5-8057-4623-8098-103d66b70966-0
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.390
Wait, let me, let me turn off.

9e2b0789-4763-4616-b000-0e0f0abab86e-0
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:31.910
My.

fc3fb1be-a6f2-4f5c-8dc4-eb13545d287c-0
00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.842
I can see the paper that you're
holding. OK. So sometimes it

fc3fb1be-a6f2-4f5c-8dc4-eb13545d287c-1
00:15:36.842 --> 00:15:38.300
goes away, sometimes.

acabbe06-79e9-4197-8570-e0477fb08079-0
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:43.554
Higher. It goes away, but I can
see it now. Yeah. Picking

acabbe06-79e9-4197-8570-e0477fb08079-1
00:15:43.554 --> 00:15:47.425
ticket. OK, yeah, we have the
pick ticket. We take this and it

acabbe06-79e9-4197-8570-e0477fb08079-2
00:15:47.425 --> 00:15:48.039
will have.

4773fb32-e126-4306-9fb0-69d426ead9a3-0
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.513
The end well the the actual
items listed on it, and we have

4773fb32-e126-4306-9fb0-69d426ead9a3-1
00:15:54.513 --> 00:15:59.986
to physically go and select
whichever one of those items it

4773fb32-e126-4306-9fb0-69d426ead9a3-2
00:15:59.986 --> 00:16:00.259
is.

0da2165c-5125-4621-9441-5081544d17f1-0
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.090
And then um.

e218b3e2-0af7-40b1-a792-325ef28832c9-0
00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:08.141
Once we've collected all of the
items and we've packaged them

e218b3e2-0af7-40b1-a792-325ef28832c9-1
00:16:08.141 --> 00:16:10.010
up, we then go to two ship.

b4aec973-0d47-403c-865d-813e1e68cb3f-0
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:17.179
And we have to physically type
in the ship to address

b4aec973-0d47-403c-865d-813e1e68cb3f-1
00:16:17.179 --> 00:16:18.550
information.

ed9ca4fc-2014-45ae-a20b-6a7e35c975d5-0
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:24.931
All of like the weight of the
box, the dimensions of the box,

ed9ca4fc-2014-45ae-a20b-6a7e35c975d5-1
00:16:24.931 --> 00:16:29.713
and then the reference numbers
and the order number on to the

ed9ca4fc-2014-45ae-a20b-6a7e35c975d5-2
00:16:29.713 --> 00:16:34.187
actual 2 ship program and then
we hit print and we make a

ed9ca4fc-2014-45ae-a20b-6a7e35c975d5-3
00:16:34.187 --> 00:16:34.650
label.

a78d9e80-3115-4e45-9cd3-a16a98ad68f6-0
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:40.273
Um, put the label on the box or
envelope of the items that are

a78d9e80-3115-4e45-9cd3-a16a98ad68f6-1
00:16:40.273 --> 00:16:44.973
being shipped and then that goes
on to either a FedEx Ground

a78d9e80-3115-4e45-9cd3-a16a98ad68f6-2
00:16:44.973 --> 00:16:47.670
truck, FedEx Express or UPS
truck.

b4621840-35e4-4ecb-90dd-04d342c10363-0
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.080
And then um.

0b80f0a2-69fc-4de1-8e6a-cc57fd4e7de1-0
00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.662
We put the tracking information
from the shipping label because

0b80f0a2-69fc-4de1-8e6a-cc57fd4e7de1-1
00:16:55.662 --> 00:16:59.181
there's two parts to a shipping
label. There's a tracking

0b80f0a2-69fc-4de1-8e6a-cc57fd4e7de1-2
00:16:59.181 --> 00:17:03.064
information like a small little
bit and then there's the actual

0b80f0a2-69fc-4de1-8e6a-cc57fd4e7de1-3
00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:06.886
label that goes on the box. So
the tracking information we put

0b80f0a2-69fc-4de1-8e6a-cc57fd4e7de1-4
00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:10.526
on the second page of the pick
ticket because it's prints 2

0b80f0a2-69fc-4de1-8e6a-cc57fd4e7de1-5
00:17:10.526 --> 00:17:14.287
pages, one goes on to the actual
item box that's going to the

0b80f0a2-69fc-4de1-8e6a-cc57fd4e7de1-6
00:17:14.287 --> 00:17:17.806
customer so that they have a
copy of. It's like a packing

0b80f0a2-69fc-4de1-8e6a-cc57fd4e7de1-7
00:17:17.806 --> 00:17:18.110
list.

08177724-191c-4135-add4-8b277b9629af-0
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.300
Kind of video and then the
second page with the actual.

d01982d7-224e-49bd-bdbb-6341b118c030-0
00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:30.165
Tracking information sticker
this is what we take to

d01982d7-224e-49bd-bdbb-6341b118c030-1
00:17:30.165 --> 00:17:35.859
accounting and then Ellen goes
in and types in the order number

d01982d7-224e-49bd-bdbb-6341b118c030-2
00:17:35.859 --> 00:17:40.130
and then she types in the
tracking information.

b7d501db-340c-4425-a85f-0792f19b4a88-0
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:45.209
And I think the date that it
actually shipped out and then

b7d501db-340c-4425-a85f-0792f19b4a88-1
00:17:45.209 --> 00:17:49.548
she changes it from status 4 to
status 9 and completes the

b7d501db-340c-4425-a85f-0792f19b4a88-2
00:17:49.548 --> 00:17:49.989
order.

b4beb6d9-8407-4ac0-8f98-68444a7510cd-0
00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.330
OK, so.

e1521ffe-8c3b-45f7-a0aa-0b6a234d0911-0
00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:02.673
Have five general steps. I
understand there are some sub

e1521ffe-8c3b-45f7-a0aa-0b6a234d0911-1
00:18:02.673 --> 00:18:07.333
steps underneath there. Within
these steps it sounds like you

e1521ffe-8c3b-45f7-a0aa-0b6a234d0911-2
00:18:07.333 --> 00:18:11.993
would like to have automated
updates since this pro where the

e1521ffe-8c3b-45f7-a0aa-0b6a234d0911-3
00:18:11.993 --> 00:18:16.502
status changes so that you know
which point it is at in the

e1521ffe-8c3b-45f7-a0aa-0b6a234d0911-4
00:18:16.502 --> 00:18:19.960
process fulfillment process. Is
that correct?

0ef694f6-fac5-464f-8c6f-6f07d6dcf40c-0
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.820
OK, so from what I have been
told from distribution.

8fb36e22-5d09-4fb2-9b8a-3440f094c804-0
00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.580
And it's more working with the
small partial.

0f366ca7-a9eb-4763-b922-83d761c44a2d-0
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.771
Does division of distribution
OK? I can't remember her name

0f366ca7-a9eb-4763-b922-83d761c44a2d-1
00:18:36.771 --> 00:18:38.070
that works there.

96b27fd7-426a-4cdf-bae8-d35d6f244e31-0
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.150
It used to be D, but it's not
dead anymore.

9cabc9aa-1198-41ac-b912-1a25eb4e94c4-0
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.610
Anyway, that's not important.

61c66348-d9bc-409d-9059-c4a758ff4b7b-0
00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.020
Um, so.

e2ccaa2f-4cc4-411f-b4fa-86b4d9f42670-0
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:55.914
Which when she gets a pick
ticket it's insidious 4, but as

e2ccaa2f-4cc4-411f-b4fa-86b4d9f42670-1
00:18:55.914 --> 00:19:00.962
she works on it the status
changes when she has collected

e2ccaa2f-4cc4-411f-b4fa-86b4d9f42670-2
00:19:00.962 --> 00:19:06.009
all of the items it says like
all it goes to like I think

e2ccaa2f-4cc4-411f-b4fa-86b4d9f42670-3
00:19:06.009 --> 00:19:10.970
status 5 or 6 or something like
that. I'm not 100% sure.

34acd75d-c687-40ec-85b5-84bd6c6ff5e1-0
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:18.269
And then when she like her pick
tickets have a barcode like

34acd75d-c687-40ec-85b5-84bd6c6ff5e1-1
00:19:18.269 --> 00:19:24.438
right here I think and she can
scan that barcode with the two

34acd75d-c687-40ec-85b5-84bd6c6ff5e1-2
00:19:24.438 --> 00:19:29.911
ship program and it will
actually populate the ship to

34acd75d-c687-40ec-85b5-84bd6c6ff5e1-3
00:19:29.911 --> 00:19:36.080
information and it will populate
the box information like the

34acd75d-c687-40ec-85b5-84bd6c6ff5e1-4
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.070
weight of the boxes.

2b4a50d1-fcc9-4408-b3b6-80f793d6ede5-0
00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:43.339
And all that stuff, and our
skews do have that information

2b4a50d1-fcc9-4408-b3b6-80f793d6ede5-1
00:19:43.339 --> 00:19:48.064
in the actual system, like all
of our SKUs have, how much it

2b4a50d1-fcc9-4408-b3b6-80f793d6ede5-2
00:19:48.064 --> 00:19:50.930
weighs, what the box dimensions
are.

b07dbe86-b156-4bdd-a32f-bb305c635a7a-0
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:57.947
So that it would be able to
populate that into the two ship.

b07dbe86-b156-4bdd-a32f-bb305c635a7a-1
00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:03.274
So what she does is she scans
the barcode on the ticket with

b07dbe86-b156-4bdd-a32f-bb305c635a7a-2
00:20:03.274 --> 00:20:04.060
two ship.

ef497784-b38c-434b-82f6-dfff25b2bf8b-0
00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:09.201
And it automatically generates
all of the information needed to

ef497784-b38c-434b-82f6-dfff25b2bf8b-1
00:20:09.201 --> 00:20:11.260
make an actual shipping label.

6b814303-bfde-4bc8-9a61-68552d4bfe22-0
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:17.590
And that also went once she hits
ship.

40eb4937-8ce3-4a58-9c0b-a051ba3975c6-0
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:25.385
Into ship, it again changes the
status of that order to say that

40eb4937-8ce3-4a58-9c0b-a051ba3975c6-1
00:20:25.385 --> 00:20:26.910
it is shipped.

5a9c931e-c317-411b-9a72-5032f4253a73-0
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:32.479
That the label is created and
that it it it is in motion to go

5a9c931e-c317-411b-9a72-5032f4253a73-1
00:20:32.479 --> 00:20:37.231
to the actual customer and that
is what you would like future

5a9c931e-c317-411b-9a72-5032f4253a73-2
00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:42.060
state for that part. Everything
else is working well, you just

5a9c931e-c317-411b-9a72-5032f4253a73-3
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.050
need that part to be updated,
correct?

cf0fe713-ecb7-45d4-8e2b-1069167f73fe-0
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:50.571
Right. OK. And so that's for
being able to follow within

cf0fe713-ecb7-45d4-8e2b-1069167f73fe-1
00:20:50.571 --> 00:20:55.996
syspro the ticket process from
beginning to end the entire life

cf0fe713-ecb7-45d4-8e2b-1069167f73fe-2
00:20:55.996 --> 00:21:01.081
cycle. So you said that there
were two main issues. So that

cf0fe713-ecb7-45d4-8e2b-1069167f73fe-3
00:21:01.081 --> 00:21:06.167
was the first one is the 2nd.
The second issue is that they

cf0fe713-ecb7-45d4-8e2b-1069167f73fe-4
00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:11.083
want to be able to order fabric
memos and fabric swatches

cf0fe713-ecb7-45d4-8e2b-1069167f73fe-5
00:21:11.083 --> 00:21:15.830
directly from the website and
have it work with syspro.

ff69f8d1-c274-4f08-a4ca-0617c5af1cb2-0
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:20.519
And create an actual syspro
order, kind of like how on the

ff69f8d1-c274-4f08-a4ca-0617c5af1cb2-1
00:21:20.519 --> 00:21:24.720
ecommerce sites right now if
they order like a chair.

47188058-2622-427f-b2a4-32b42ee34630-0
00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.790
It creates a syspro pick ticket.

e353142b-dba8-4310-81c6-351a9469cd3c-0
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:33.952
With that chair and the
customers shipping information

e353142b-dba8-4310-81c6-351a9469cd3c-1
00:21:33.952 --> 00:21:38.546
and all of that stuff so that
the distribution knows that,

e353142b-dba8-4310-81c6-351a9469cd3c-2
00:21:38.546 --> 00:21:43.530
hey, I need to pick this chair
and ship it to the end consumer.

889f2f4f-4662-4dbd-b639-f583014969b2-0
00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.835
OK, so when you say order from
website, what website are you

889f2f4f-4662-4dbd-b639-f583014969b2-1
00:21:48.835 --> 00:21:49.580
Speaking of?

5d367e67-d7ea-4925-9e98-29e7f0e39676-0
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:55.300
The new up and coming summer
classics.

3fd8806b-445d-451b-99b7-e0faee25db0f-0
00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:03.060
Website that portion you're
going to need to discuss more in

3fd8806b-445d-451b-99b7-e0faee25db0f-1
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.580
depth with Tom.

a7195112-6c72-4eef-9477-1dd6c5cc2de9-0
00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.730
What is his last name?

8da16a92-c4f5-4979-b0aa-72ac614cd224-0
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.377
Yeah, there you go. Thank you.
For some strange reason, I

8da16a92-c4f5-4979-b0aa-72ac614cd224-1
00:22:12.377 --> 00:22:15.803
wanted to say Adkins, but that's
not right. That's another

8da16a92-c4f5-4979-b0aa-72ac614cd224-2
00:22:15.803 --> 00:22:16.210
person.

4ff75381-71f5-477f-9f3d-3af6b69cbd0d-0
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:19.360
Um.

9661be25-553c-4a9d-aa94-8cb609585ec8-0
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:26.605
So you'll have to talk with Tom
Asher or Dondy. Dondy is

9661be25-553c-4a9d-aa94-8cb609585ec8-1
00:22:26.605 --> 00:22:28.370
apparently very.

3e074f12-9811-4645-97db-9160fc094b8f-0
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:33.140
Like this is developed deep in
that section.

3dfcedb3-ad2a-488c-9808-c0e058e47cd4-0
00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.160
OK, so that's our developer.

bf42a549-ca7a-45ed-aef5-34e1c66394e7-0
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:43.080
Yeah, OK. So in order for him he
will need the requirements, so.

0445f48b-ae8d-474c-afdb-ff5f765c48d7-0
00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:49.744
Tell me, I know I'm not familiar
with a fabric memo. What is

0445f48b-ae8d-474c-afdb-ff5f765c48d7-1
00:22:49.744 --> 00:22:55.802
that? A fabric memo is a small 5
by 5 piece of fabric that comes

0445f48b-ae8d-474c-afdb-ff5f765c48d7-2
00:22:55.802 --> 00:23:01.674
on a card that has all of the
fabric information on that card.

0445f48b-ae8d-474c-afdb-ff5f765c48d7-3
00:23:01.674 --> 00:23:07.638
So we send them to in consumers,
dealers, designers, all those,

0445f48b-ae8d-474c-afdb-ff5f765c48d7-4
00:23:07.638 --> 00:23:13.510
all the people so that they can
look at the fabric and make a.

dead157f-66ff-4205-98f1-a85884eaad17-0
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.285
Race as to what they would like
to actually order, making sure

dead157f-66ff-4205-98f1-a85884eaad17-1
00:23:17.285 --> 00:23:20.737
that the feel of the fabric is
correct, making sure that the

dead157f-66ff-4205-98f1-a85884eaad17-2
00:23:20.737 --> 00:23:23.680
color is going to match their
drapes, their carpet.

452cb8a1-5077-483e-8cf5-8627776a6489-0
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:27.380
Grandma's 5 by 5 inch.

965e369b-af6d-4b25-b311-fddfc543ac32-0
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:33.228
This one because I would have
considered that a Swatch. So

965e369b-af6d-4b25-b311-fddfc543ac32-1
00:23:33.228 --> 00:23:36.150
it's a Swatch. A Swatch is an 8
by 10.

53361d0d-1a8a-4aaf-a991-a6f5352e30f2-0
00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.160
That.

03f67874-0146-4191-a06d-798d35b03b4b-0
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:46.265
Of, um, fabric samples. So the
full Swatch set actually has all

03f67874-0146-4191-a06d-798d35b03b4b-1
00:23:46.265 --> 00:23:51.966
of the swatches, all of the
fabric options that an

03f67874-0146-4191-a06d-798d35b03b4b-2
00:23:51.966 --> 00:23:54.650
individual line carries.

f247ec90-00b3-45d9-8a21-0278c912266b-0
00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:00.133
OK, so can you or do you always
order a full set or do you order

f247ec90-00b3-45d9-8a21-0278c912266b-1
00:24:00.133 --> 00:24:04.539
partial? They are wanting to be
able to order partials. Yes

f247ec90-00b3-45d9-8a21-0278c912266b-2
00:24:04.539 --> 00:24:04.980
ma'am.

4159c231-a615-46df-9b69-7dfc716d82f7-0
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.300
And we have inventory and stock.

bc71c125-11e9-42ea-b087-b76425fff91d-0
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.960
Of those as well.

028267fa-e809-42df-8997-aa8729133974-0
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:18.043
But as of right now, there is
not a way to order that through

028267fa-e809-42df-8997-aa8729133974-1
00:24:18.043 --> 00:24:18.940
the system.

c4bdaaa9-c884-45d4-b5d3-4e58799671d6-0
00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:25.485
You can currently only order
full set, full Swatch sets, OK

c4bdaaa9-c884-45d4-b5d3-4e58799671d6-1
00:24:25.485 --> 00:24:30.100
right, alright, so they want to
be able to do that through the

c4bdaaa9-c884-45d4-b5d3-4e58799671d6-2
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:30.980
website, so.

08467a28-2598-43c5-8b62-4e4cd6598d7c-0
00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.539
Future state? What would that
look like for you? What would be

08467a28-2598-43c5-8b62-4e4cd6598d7c-1
00:24:38.539 --> 00:24:42.412
the process that you would
expect to see? What would you

08467a28-2598-43c5-8b62-4e4cd6598d7c-2
00:24:42.412 --> 00:24:44.790
consider a solution to that
issue?

7818b9ee-70da-4f99-8837-cf9ffce9e63b-0
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:51.023
So currently we receive online
emails from the memo ordering

7818b9ee-70da-4f99-8837-cf9ffce9e63b-1
00:24:51.023 --> 00:24:55.989
that is currently on the
website. Umm, I said that wrong.

7818b9ee-70da-4f99-8837-cf9ffce9e63b-2
00:24:55.989 --> 00:25:01.469
That that that didn't make any
sense. It's late in the day that

7818b9ee-70da-4f99-8837-cf9ffce9e63b-3
00:25:01.469 --> 00:25:05.580
was not English. I mean, it was,
but it wasn't.

7036c0b6-f44c-44a0-9cb6-f6173930a3fe-0
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:12.998
So when a currently when a
customer goes online they can

7036c0b6-f44c-44a0-9cb6-f6173930a3fe-1
00:25:12.998 --> 00:25:17.975
order memos that way, but it
comes to us through an e-mail

7036c0b6-f44c-44a0-9cb6-f6173930a3fe-2
00:25:17.975 --> 00:25:23.543
and there is no way to track and
inventory that. And the customer

7036c0b6-f44c-44a0-9cb6-f6173930a3fe-3
00:25:23.543 --> 00:25:28.436
is not put into the syspro
system or the sugar system. So

7036c0b6-f44c-44a0-9cb6-f6173930a3fe-4
00:25:28.436 --> 00:25:32.907
that there is no way to
currently see the conversion

7036c0b6-f44c-44a0-9cb6-f6173930a3fe-5
00:25:32.907 --> 00:25:37.800
rate from a customer ordering a
memo sample to eventually

7036c0b6-f44c-44a0-9cb6-f6173930a3fe-6
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.559
possibly.

9869c8a6-a4ce-466b-a416-c44465a57788-0
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:43.333
Ordering a chair or a couch and
they want to be able to see and

9869c8a6-a4ce-466b-a416-c44465a57788-1
00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:47.889
follow that conversion rate. So
that's why they want it to be

9869c8a6-a4ce-466b-a416-c44465a57788-2
00:25:47.889 --> 00:25:52.518
able to, instead of coming to me
as an e-mail, they want it to

9869c8a6-a4ce-466b-a416-c44465a57788-3
00:25:52.518 --> 00:25:54.650
come to me as a syspro order.

53d5278e-938b-4ded-8192-e4e39f197608-0
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.382
So we need to convert the lead
basically, yes. So you need to

53d5278e-938b-4ded-8192-e4e39f197608-1
00:25:59.382 --> 00:26:02.280
convert the lead into a
potential customer.

84a5e627-d0f2-4b94-acc4-8cae3bb75d67-0
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.820
In order to track.

f0767fcd-9e61-4e1e-a74e-a5fb97e2575b-0
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.922
Is that correct? So that in
that, so if that potential

f0767fcd-9e61-4e1e-a74e-a5fb97e2575b-1
00:26:09.922 --> 00:26:13.780
customer then comes back, you
can pull up the information and

f0767fcd-9e61-4e1e-a74e-a5fb97e2575b-2
00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.701
notice that they order Swatch, I
don't know, 549 or something.

f0767fcd-9e61-4e1e-a74e-a5fb97e2575b-3
00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:21.621
Yeah, previously correct. And
then you can see whether they're

f0767fcd-9e61-4e1e-a74e-a5fb97e2575b-4
00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:25.542
actually gonna order 549 or if
they wanna completely different

f0767fcd-9e61-4e1e-a74e-a5fb97e2575b-5
00:26:25.542 --> 00:26:29.462
way or if they never come back,
how long it takes them to come

f0767fcd-9e61-4e1e-a74e-a5fb97e2575b-6
00:26:29.462 --> 00:26:33.071
back, etcetera, right where
they're coming from, all that

f0767fcd-9e61-4e1e-a74e-a5fb97e2575b-7
00:26:33.071 --> 00:26:35.249
customer information
demographics?

26d7e5b7-eeb4-43e9-861d-e96610a0a014-0
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:43.722
So really there's like four or
five different things that all

26d7e5b7-eeb4-43e9-861d-e96610a0a014-1
00:26:43.722 --> 00:26:44.900
of this benefits.

24dc8f45-4704-41d8-9fa8-b3ebc86aa5d9-0
00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.109
Fill them out for me so I can
make sure that I have them

24dc8f45-4704-41d8-9fa8-b3ebc86aa5d9-1
00:26:49.109 --> 00:26:49.560
correctly.

58515579-71bd-476d-8fa4-7d88382054cc-0
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:54.120
Yeah, because I do have to list
the benefits as well, yeah.

252a14ac-2a54-4060-a442-32bbb050403b-0
00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:01.795
Be definitely being able to
track conversion from memo order

252a14ac-2a54-4060-a442-32bbb050403b-1
00:27:01.795 --> 00:27:08.463
to product order, being able to
have better customer visibility

252a14ac-2a54-4060-a442-32bbb050403b-2
00:27:08.463 --> 00:27:10.860
on their sample orders.

7af161a0-5983-45bc-a487-9c21795d7129-0
00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.857
So that they'll know like where
it is and like what stage of the

7af161a0-5983-45bc-a487-9c21795d7129-1
00:27:15.857 --> 00:27:16.920
process it's at.

d19bf720-474e-4b5c-856d-2667414171c0-0
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:25.607
Being able to keep a better
inventory of usage of how many

d19bf720-474e-4b5c-856d-2667414171c0-1
00:27:25.607 --> 00:27:31.580
memos actually go out fabric
wise and being able to

d19bf720-474e-4b5c-856d-2667414171c0-2
00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:36.060
automatically populate to ship
labels.

47f4512c-8cf5-412b-b7a4-4ce46b386e1b-0
00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:40.330
Will increase productivity for
my team?

31210122-4732-4da3-bbce-c9353846b1e8-0
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:48.724
Being able to automatically scan
new items into inventory will

31210122-4732-4da3-bbce-c9353846b1e8-1
00:27:48.724 --> 00:27:53.270
definitely assist in
productivity of my team.

0a056039-5859-4693-a6a3-3bf1938e7c3e-0
00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:55.660
Umm.

718bf151-df02-4ee4-831a-1849efd21b69-0
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:03.010
And being able to fully order
memos.

d3db43b4-7bc3-41fc-8d13-06e099bb6c12-0
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:08.472
Online on the new website
because without the upgraded

d3db43b4-7bc3-41fc-8d13-06e099bb6c12-1
00:28:08.472 --> 00:28:13.311
system, the new website ordering
memos is not going to work,

d3db43b4-7bc3-41fc-8d13-06e099bb6c12-2
00:28:13.311 --> 00:28:14.660
according to Tom.

ac691683-e425-433d-8b46-a0eab1031c6b-0
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.300
Like that it's it's just it's it
won't be possible.

3db353cf-3e4d-4890-9dc1-8a72eb876ec2-0
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:26.396
To order Members has to be done
in order to OK, that's important

3db353cf-3e4d-4890-9dc1-8a72eb876ec2-1
00:28:26.396 --> 00:28:27.170
to note.

e10bd794-390d-4dc1-801d-9944ab6564c6-0
00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:28.490
Yeah.

5b624e47-a361-4cf6-a606-268c97815cad-0
00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:34.880
So all of all of step one needs
to be done in order for Step 2.

f6eb60f2-9b56-46a3-8e4c-d358d3932883-0
00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:36.690
Yep.

ba847de2-4cbd-4e58-8e5c-635dd5264848-0
00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.958
So can you tell me in general,
just the general ballpark about

ba847de2-4cbd-4e58-8e5c-635dd5264848-1
00:28:47.958 --> 00:28:51.746
how many people would this
affect that, that it would

ba847de2-4cbd-4e58-8e5c-635dd5264848-2
00:28:51.746 --> 00:28:53.710
increase their productivity?

8363e066-b0e3-4c67-ab3b-bb7b7ce25e54-0
00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.620
My team is a team of five, OK?

c897170d-cd35-4c2f-977a-a65d4ab76396-0
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.180
5.

1458e5e7-1c92-4f1e-9366-1301da7edcf2-0
00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:09.022
OK. And then also can you tell
me what are those titles? Are

1458e5e7-1c92-4f1e-9366-1301da7edcf2-1
00:29:09.022 --> 00:29:14.250
they just in general these
market specialists, OK.

f00941fe-913c-4906-86ec-114d1250862f-0
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.700
And I am marketing fulfillment
supervisor.

df6e5e53-177c-4d8a-ab10-9fa7c8e50bda-0
00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:19.730
Huh.

3415091c-733a-4bc2-9cc2-0064e1231c3c-0
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.040
All right. And so the only
department.

917132a3-421b-4320-b133-c59199daf5eb-0
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:32.706
That this will would actually
end up affecting productivity

917132a3-421b-4320-b133-c59199daf5eb-1
00:29:32.706 --> 00:29:37.827
wise this marketing, is that
correct? I believe it would also

917132a3-421b-4320-b133-c59199daf5eb-2
00:29:37.827 --> 00:29:42.783
assist in customer service, both
wholesale and contract and

917132a3-421b-4320-b133-c59199daf5eb-3
00:29:42.783 --> 00:29:47.987
ecommerce as well because they
will not have to Umm, e-mail me

917132a3-421b-4320-b133-c59199daf5eb-4
00:29:47.987 --> 00:29:52.530
to figure out where the actual
order is in the system.

0d68d750-15d9-41e5-b62d-f7237e13218f-0
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:57.408
If it's been completed, if it's
been shipped, what's the

0d68d750-15d9-41e5-b62d-f7237e13218f-1
00:29:57.408 --> 00:30:01.893
tracking information? Because I
do receive regular requests of

0d68d750-15d9-41e5-b62d-f7237e13218f-2
00:30:01.893 --> 00:30:06.307
where like I see that it's been
printed, has it actually been

0d68d750-15d9-41e5-b62d-f7237e13218f-3
00:30:06.307 --> 00:30:10.864
shipped. And then I have to go
through my emails and I actually

0d68d750-15d9-41e5-b62d-f7237e13218f-4
00:30:10.864 --> 00:30:14.709
have to get every single two
ship e-mail notification

0d68d750-15d9-41e5-b62d-f7237e13218f-5
00:30:14.709 --> 00:30:19.052
currently so that I can give
somebody tracking when they ask

0d68d750-15d9-41e5-b62d-f7237e13218f-6
00:30:19.052 --> 00:30:23.252
and they do ask on a regular
basis. It's not like a once a

0d68d750-15d9-41e5-b62d-f7237e13218f-7
00:30:23.252 --> 00:30:23.680
month.

d21fed18-038a-4634-b868-e1dae96a08ac-0
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:26.450
Kind of thing. It's a it's a few
times a day.

9e1032d7-313f-4d94-93e7-700f0bccb358-0
00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:32.312
In customer service, yes ma'am.
From customers calling in to

9e1032d7-313f-4d94-93e7-700f0bccb358-1
00:30:32.312 --> 00:30:35.910
them asking them for updates,
I'm assuming yes.

0fa5ed9e-86ab-43d9-8dc5-71f88e9f825a-0
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:42.998
And same for the e-mail memo
requests. I always respond to

0fa5ed9e-86ab-43d9-8dc5-71f88e9f825a-1
00:30:42.998 --> 00:30:48.015
those e-mail requests saying,
hey, we've got your order, we're

0fa5ed9e-86ab-43d9-8dc5-71f88e9f825a-2
00:30:48.015 --> 00:30:52.713
getting ready to process it,
it'll ship out this via USPS,

0fa5ed9e-86ab-43d9-8dc5-71f88e9f825a-3
00:30:52.713 --> 00:30:55.579
you you should get tracking
e-mail.

33c20b27-2377-4bd9-b858-a53953fea45a-0
00:30:56.990 --> 00:31:00.745
Once it's been shipped however,
a lot of times the tracking

33c20b27-2377-4bd9-b858-a53953fea45a-1
00:31:00.745 --> 00:31:04.626
e-mail apparently goes to like
their junk junk file so and or

33c20b27-2377-4bd9-b858-a53953fea45a-2
00:31:04.626 --> 00:31:08.507
they don't look for it in the
1st place. Like they don't know

33c20b27-2377-4bd9-b858-a53953fea45a-3
00:31:08.507 --> 00:31:12.451
to look for it. Even though I
tell them that hey it's going to

33c20b27-2377-4bd9-b858-a53953fea45a-4
00:31:12.451 --> 00:31:16.457
come but it's not coming from me
in that same e-mail thread and

33c20b27-2377-4bd9-b858-a53953fea45a-5
00:31:16.457 --> 00:31:19.461

asummerclassics.com e-mail

33c20b27-2377-4bd9-b858-a53953fea45a-6

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:26.088
And they don't know to look for
that, so I will have to go

777c33b6-2a70-4d2c-85cb-80830f33d00b-1
00:31:26.088 --> 00:31:30.261

00:31:30.261 --> 00:31:34.500
back to them as opposed to them
just being able to like look it

777c33b6-2a70-4d2c-85cb-80830f33d00b-3

a question for you.

3ad25b80-d25f-4a4e-947c-0a17f662e0e5-0
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.850
For those that require payment.

9f0aaa74-c3ec-4dac-9847-39c4f80fcca3-0
00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.131
How does that occur? Do they
check out there and make a

9f0aaa74-c3ec-4dac-9847-39c4f80fcca3-1
00:34:17.131 --> 00:34:17.550
payment?

fd57eff3-aa2b-4465-aee0-fae67880cca0-0
00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:24.265
So if those ones aren't only the
five by 5 memos which are free

fd57eff3-aa2b-4465-aee0-fae67880cca0-1
00:34:24.265 --> 00:34:29.533
up to 10 and up to 24 current
existing customers in good

fd57eff3-aa2b-4465-aee0-fae67880cca0-2
00:34:29.533 --> 00:34:34.709
standing. So if they have
requested over the 10 or over

fd57eff3-aa2b-4465-aee0-fae67880cca0-3
00:34:34.709 --> 00:34:39.977
the 20, we do have to go into
syspro as long as they are

fd57eff3-aa2b-4465-aee0-fae67880cca0-4
00:34:39.977 --> 00:34:45.707
inactive customer with like a
credit card on file or a net 30

fd57eff3-aa2b-4465-aee0-fae67880cca0-5
00:34:45.707 --> 00:34:48.849
depending upon like how they
pay.

6b18e97b-e194-4564-9111-b88b56bf3e82-0
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.711
We have to go into their account
in syspro and create a second

6b18e97b-e194-4564-9111-b88b56bf3e82-1
00:34:53.711 --> 00:34:57.474
order and that's how we charge
them because we can't charge

6b18e97b-e194-4564-9111-b88b56bf3e82-2
00:34:57.474 --> 00:35:01.363
them for through a credit card
or anything like that, because

6b18e97b-e194-4564-9111-b88b56bf3e82-3
00:35:01.363 --> 00:35:05.001
we can't take credit card
information over the phone. And

6b18e97b-e194-4564-9111-b88b56bf3e82-4
00:35:05.001 --> 00:35:08.890
also, I don't do money, I'm not
an accountant, that's my job.

0d6883de-ab9f-48d3-9dc0-dc0183abc1bf-0
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:14.380
If it comes in your, what does
exactly? How is that working OK.

339da618-f966-4b0e-8980-faa98b648f2e-0
00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:18.956
Yeah, yeah. So if it does
require money, we do have to

339da618-f966-4b0e-8980-faa98b648f2e-1
00:35:18.956 --> 00:35:23.478
actually go into syspro, type up
an order and then send it over

339da618-f966-4b0e-8980-faa98b648f2e-2
00:35:23.478 --> 00:35:27.718
to accounting for them to get
payment. And that is what you

339da618-f966-4b0e-8980-faa98b648f2e-3
00:35:27.718 --> 00:35:31.110
would do or someone on your team
would do that.

97ca2652-8d58-471f-8842-90942eb11d65-0
00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:36.732
Which is just adds another step,
right? Which is why I was, I was

97ca2652-8d58-471f-8842-90942eb11d65-1
00:35:36.732 --> 00:35:40.066
as you were talking, I was
thinking to myself wait a

97ca2652-8d58-471f-8842-90942eb11d65-2
00:35:40.066 --> 00:35:43.527
minute, how, how, how was it
being, what's the intake?

97ca2652-8d58-471f-8842-90942eb11d65-3
00:35:43.527 --> 00:35:47.490
Because you keep saying you're
gonna e-mail, but where, how am

97ca2652-8d58-471f-8842-90942eb11d65-4
00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:50.762
I as a, as a retailer, in
customer, how am I as the

97ca2652-8d58-471f-8842-90942eb11d65-5
00:35:50.762 --> 00:35:54.411
customer getting that because
you're now dealing customer

97ca2652-8d58-471f-8842-90942eb11d65-6
00:35:54.411 --> 00:35:58.437
face. Anyway, my mind was like
wait a minute, we didn't discuss

97ca2652-8d58-471f-8842-90942eb11d65-7
00:35:58.437 --> 00:36:02.149
intake. OK, alright. So I think
I have a good grasp of the

97ca2652-8d58-471f-8842-90942eb11d65-8
00:36:02.149 --> 00:36:02.589
basics.

e064fb1d-8159-4dd6-ad46-9f22bd7da53a-0
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:07.498
So what? What happened is I'm
going to write up a requirements

e064fb1d-8159-4dd6-ad46-9f22bd7da53a-1
00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:12.232
document and then I will e-mail
it to you and ask you to review.

e064fb1d-8159-4dd6-ad46-9f22bd7da53a-2
00:36:12.232 --> 00:36:16.966
You'll have editing everything.
This is a collaborative process.

e064fb1d-8159-4dd6-ad46-9f22bd7da53a-3
00:36:16.966 --> 00:36:21.555
This isn't like I go into a lab
and spit it out and then go. I

e064fb1d-8159-4dd6-ad46-9f22bd7da53a-4
00:36:21.555 --> 00:36:26.071
shipped it off to IT. That's not
what this is. This is. We're

e064fb1d-8159-4dd6-ad46-9f22bd7da53a-5
00:36:26.071 --> 00:36:30.513

bit and then once it where I

And you approve it, then it will
get placed over with IT for

c7a5d3d5-0f76-40f1-b33b-ada7df8bb924-1
00:36:47.724 --> 00:36:51.427

they don't understand will make
some more notes. And then once

c7a5d3d5-0f76-40f1-b33b-ada7df8bb924-5
00:37:03.213 --> 00:37:07.101

etcetera.

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:15.035
OK, OK. Alright. So I am hoping

306da4be-a1e0-41cc-89cb-6e6aff6b3fa2-1

Because in order for the new
website to launch, my system has

306da4be-a1e0-41cc-89cb-6e6aff6b3fa2-2

00:38:15.401 --> 00:38:19.952
website and what that section of
it is. Because again, like I

b807d96c-3a23-4e5e-b930-c1ece99d3fbd-4
00:38:19.952 --> 00:38:23.770
don't do money, I don't do code.
That's not my job.

00:38:45.471 --> 00:38:48.813
for the website that it
incorporates your needs from

72d1a40e-2714-4e8d-b0d3-835513a59dc4-4
