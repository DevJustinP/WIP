00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.550
Hello everyone.

3b8fef9e-e14c-4cc2-ad09-3c3152951b3a-0
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.850
Hi.

fda0ef40-0010-4c09-92c1-ba01401fd1b9-0
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.210
Think we are missing?

61a7bb99-d2ca-458a-8713-8555baa36f99-0
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.820
Maybe two or three people. I'll
give him just a minute.

cb257c6d-39a0-462a-aaee-3f9fdb2da328-0
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.290
It is a Friday after a short
week.

54c966a3-becd-4518-883c-c13f147dad42-0
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.200
So.

dd991c06-5a7a-40df-8ea3-7178130d2a13-0
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.340
It may take them just a moment
to get on.

d15c1458-0096-41a3-be49-1470326fde92-0
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:50.380


a21c9e66-a8c2-4450-b407-9711f8b58013-0
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:10.380


285c55e5-5ea1-43b2-a573-08086771d934-0
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.350
Alright, it is 2 after. We'll go
ahead and get started and others

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.694
can can join in as we get going.
So I believe I may have been on

285c55e5-5ea1-43b2-a573-08086771d934-2
00:01:32.694 --> 00:01:36.771
meetings with the handful of
you, but not everybody. My name

285c55e5-5ea1-43b2-a573-08086771d934-3
00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:39.110
is Stephanie Hawkins, I am new
to.

c1aa382b-f968-415e-8fe4-4f1988ceb858-0
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.426
I was I get summer classes and
then I want to say, yeah, you at

c1aa382b-f968-415e-8fe4-4f1988ceb858-1
00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:48.010
the same time. I am new. I am a
BA. I work with Ben.

1b80477d-9ea8-4bab-a9c2-c9f26268ecca-0
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.250
And.

1e27761b-04ec-4479-ae1f-bf08bd9fa98e-0
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.470
I essentially am here to now
start gathering requirements.

205b7ab1-b5f1-4cb0-83ee-c76bc7c77748-0
00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.526
4 enhancements, new products,
projects, etcetera that need to

205b7ab1-b5f1-4cb0-83ee-c76bc7c77748-1
00:02:00.526 --> 00:02:03.870
take place within Southern,
Southern.

59d5b445-4203-4329-8a1e-04df24c5e7d2-0
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.190
Summer classics and Gabby.

789075ae-78e7-45fb-9c8a-04c066237556-0
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.935
So essentially what will happen
is this meeting is really

789075ae-78e7-45fb-9c8a-04c066237556-1
00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:15.181
introductory. It's for me to
kind of get background on this

789075ae-78e7-45fb-9c8a-04c066237556-2
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:19.853
particular rock. Essentially all
that I've been given is what was

789075ae-78e7-45fb-9c8a-04c066237556-3
00:02:19.853 --> 00:02:23.958
included in the meeting meeting
notice. So kind of gather

789075ae-78e7-45fb-9c8a-04c066237556-4
00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:28.417
everybody here so I can get a
general scope, a general idea of

789075ae-78e7-45fb-9c8a-04c066237556-5
00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:32.380
of the current issues and
current desired solutions and

789075ae-78e7-45fb-9c8a-04c066237556-6
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.839
then I go back and I write it up
into a requirements document.

3d637c3b-1bbf-4cf9-b9ea-1b08e10b04ee-0
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.884
You guys review it and kind of
tell me if I'm on the right

3d637c3b-1bbf-4cf9-b9ea-1b08e10b04ee-1
00:02:40.884 --> 00:02:44.731
track, anything that I'm
missing, anything that's come up

3d637c3b-1bbf-4cf9-b9ea-1b08e10b04ee-2
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:49.043
that needs to be added and then
once we can all agree, we'll get

3d637c3b-1bbf-4cf9-b9ea-1b08e10b04ee-3
00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:53.090
approval and then it will get
passed over to IT development,

3d637c3b-1bbf-4cf9-b9ea-1b08e10b04ee-4
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.269
dondy, kather, etcetera for to
be scheduled within their world

3d637c3b-1bbf-4cf9-b9ea-1b08e10b04ee-5
00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.183
to actually have it developed,
coded and put out there for

3d637c3b-1bbf-4cf9-b9ea-1b08e10b04ee-6
00:03:01.183 --> 00:03:05.363
testing and implementation. So
that's kind of what I do on a a

3d637c3b-1bbf-4cf9-b9ea-1b08e10b04ee-7
00:03:05.363 --> 00:03:06.690
quick little bundle.

dfa581b8-1f8a-4329-ae1f-7584131af803-0
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.816
I did see Carlos that her
meeting was running over, so she

dfa581b8-1f8a-4329-ae1f-7584131af803-1
00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:13.930
will be over just shortly, but
we'll go ahead and get started.

6913e2d6-1118-4690-805e-0bf1c35f73c0-0
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.509
For me, the only thing that I
have is that being basically

6913e2d6-1118-4690-805e-0bf1c35f73c0-1
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.973
said that we should be
automating the invoicing process

6913e2d6-1118-4690-805e-0bf1c35f73c0-2
00:03:22.973 --> 00:03:23.839
for wholesale.

cb592883-1ef1-4c2c-a445-810c149d453f-0
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.510
Um, he wanted to get an idea of
what happens when applying

cb592883-1ef1-4c2c-a445-810c149d453f-1
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.906
deposits for different types of
invoices, for instance, prepaid,

cb592883-1ef1-4c2c-a445-810c149d453f-2
00:03:32.906 --> 00:03:36.761
as well as ensuring that the
branding and formatting are

cb592883-1ef1-4c2c-a445-810c149d453f-3
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:40.481
correct, wanted to streamline
the number of emails and

cb592883-1ef1-4c2c-a445-810c149d453f-4
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:44.472
invoices that are sent and
received and make sure that the

cb592883-1ef1-4c2c-a445-810c149d453f-5
00:03:44.472 --> 00:03:48.259
brand identity and inclusion is
up to date and correct.

4f9e52b7-9f1f-4713-b510-bdb8600387b5-0
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.098
So I must apologize I don't know
exactly who is in each one of

4f9e52b7-9f1f-4713-b510-bdb8600387b5-1
00:03:54.098 --> 00:03:58.322
these two areas, but I would
like to start with the

4f9e52b7-9f1f-4713-b510-bdb8600387b5-2
00:03:58.322 --> 00:04:03.603
automation of invoicing process
for wholesale account of want to

4f9e52b7-9f1f-4713-b510-bdb8600387b5-3
00:04:03.603 --> 00:04:08.559
get a background on what is
currently done in a nutshell and

4f9e52b7-9f1f-4713-b510-bdb8600387b5-4
00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:11.890
then kind of what is desired to
be done.

b6ce4133-c94b-4d98-80d9-2f4dcf37e899-0
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.980
Well, I do the invoicing and
Trish.

17465de6-c717-4a4e-89ce-84a0cbeed381-0
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.810
Backs me up.

fbdb852d-755f-4d94-8f71-3085c3a57c93-0
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.030
And.

14ca5b64-496f-4b42-853f-35296c98e91c-0
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.170
What happens he is.

6d5f4bed-66e2-4e51-93f7-e6719658a115-0
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.490
The, the. The.

43d9156f-719c-48f0-823d-90f2ec430f04-0
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.350
All the orders are in the
dispatch notes.

ba50cad9-50ce-4883-b0d7-82fa6e2afbfc-0
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.430
And I invoice from dispatch
notes.

ac08f79c-39be-4d2f-9308-7f51d472bc83-0
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.210
I just go in and I click on it
and.

7b4692d4-b85d-421b-9f98-15c3cab80204-0
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.340
If there's money on the order, I
take the payment.

6f26e593-b812-4909-9ce6-fe05f1663122-0
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.310
There's not you just invoice
that I.

319ac165-df1f-4a58-9cf0-8fd373f1710e-0
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.990
OK. And so.

7bca0ac1-7f44-4f34-ab8a-303b3c61bb35-0
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.730
Go ahead. Go ahead.

934346dd-bc67-4153-b4b1-7596d93a806c-0
00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.910
That that's I mean.

130531c3-1976-44a1-b336-da3bfe2ec839-0
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.470
There's different.

0100b91e-99fa-4e7b-a884-19a870823c25-0
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.577
Like I get a lot of marketing
invoices that I just invoice.

0100b91e-99fa-4e7b-a884-19a870823c25-1
00:05:09.577 --> 00:05:14.789
They're not from dispatch notes.
I just invoice those what I call

0100b91e-99fa-4e7b-a884-19a870823c25-2
00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.579
the old way before we went to
this patch notes.

0c4ecadb-487c-4c38-af6f-137fe9d1b619-0
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.450
What do you mean by you get a
lot of marketing invoices? I'm

0c4ecadb-487c-4c38-af6f-137fe9d1b619-1
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.550
on the marketing team by the
way. Ohh goyen.

2cbd7547-17e5-4ee0-a8ef-20a59fcea830-0
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.710
Going in.

221b2d74-4e3d-480f-aa32-b597c5f38d9c-0
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.576
Every time she ships out, I get
an invoice for it. Most of it's

221b2d74-4e3d-480f-aa32-b597c5f38d9c-1
00:05:33.576 --> 00:05:36.830
no charge, but every one of them
have to be invoiced.

46c88825-5769-4dc1-aa43-aeb306192422-0
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.340
And those things like marketing
swatches and memos, yes.

e18318cc-59ed-4bb3-b03f-ea1f42501880-0
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.186
All right. And if we could
somehow get those put into

e18318cc-59ed-4bb3-b03f-ea1f42501880-1
00:05:46.186 --> 00:05:50.227
dispatch new nutrish, we can't
hear you at all. I don't know

e18318cc-59ed-4bb3-b03f-ea1f42501880-2
00:05:50.227 --> 00:05:51.420
what's wrong, but.

1bdbe853-a338-4fd0-b5c1-95b410bc5395-0
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.155
We couldn't hear you in the
level 10 yesterday. Can you hear

1bdbe853-a338-4fd0-b5c1-95b410bc5395-1
00:05:57.155 --> 00:06:01.456
me now? Yeah, OK. I thought I
switched it off. Sometimes these

1bdbe853-a338-4fd0-b5c1-95b410bc5395-2
00:06:01.456 --> 00:06:05.690
work better for me. So if we
could get those marketing orders

1bdbe853-a338-4fd0-b5c1-95b410bc5395-3
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.581
like that put into dispatch
notes, I think it'd be a lot

1bdbe853-a338-4fd0-b5c1-95b410bc5395-4
00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:14.088
easier because that's a lot more
manual for Miss Ellen to do that

1bdbe853-a338-4fd0-b5c1-95b410bc5395-5
00:06:14.088 --> 00:06:18.185
and and there's a lot of them
every day. Yeah. Can we level

1bdbe853-a338-4fd0-b5c1-95b410bc5395-6
00:06:18.185 --> 00:06:22.282
set on what you mean by so,
meaning if a wholesale customer

1bdbe853-a338-4fd0-b5c1-95b410bc5395-7
00:06:22.282 --> 00:06:22.759
places?

e34166ab-1ec0-443d-b4ac-4277f0906083-0
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.207
In order for Swatch samples or
anything out of marketing

e34166ab-1ec0-443d-b4ac-4277f0906083-1
00:06:26.207 --> 00:06:29.407
fulfillment, it's an invoice
that we create for those

e34166ab-1ec0-443d-b4ac-4277f0906083-2
00:06:29.407 --> 00:06:32.844
materials there. I realize
they're often 0 charge, but we

e34166ab-1ec0-443d-b4ac-4277f0906083-3
00:06:32.844 --> 00:06:36.518
still have to create an invoice
because that product is going

e34166ab-1ec0-443d-b4ac-4277f0906083-4
00:06:36.518 --> 00:06:40.251
out of her warehouse and going
to a customer, correct. Is that

e34166ab-1ec0-443d-b4ac-4277f0906083-5
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:43.570
right? Yeah. And it's just
invoice from the peak ticket

e34166ab-1ec0-443d-b4ac-4277f0906083-6
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.170
that's I get a peak ticket.

2b0dd4c2-dfe7-4a63-8b76-8d0b2b6aaeb2-0
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.553
And our invoice from that, yeah,
I think part of the problem is

2b0dd4c2-dfe7-4a63-8b76-8d0b2b6aaeb2-1
00:06:49.553 --> 00:06:52.638
hers are difference because
she's not on the same syspro

2b0dd4c2-dfe7-4a63-8b76-8d0b2b6aaeb2-2
00:06:52.638 --> 00:06:55.993
system as everybody. So there's
a lot of I've elevated it now

2b0dd4c2-dfe7-4a63-8b76-8d0b2b6aaeb2-3
00:06:55.993 --> 00:06:59.241
and it's kind of moved to the
top of the list. She's not in

2b0dd4c2-dfe7-4a63-8b76-8d0b2b6aaeb2-4
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:02.650
the same warehouse and says bro
as everybody and it's a really

2b0dd4c2-dfe7-4a63-8b76-8d0b2b6aaeb2-5
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.300
big problem.

238356cf-8ccd-473c-8d6b-115ae6d1efe0-0
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.380
And she is that Gwen or Ellen?
Gwen. Gwen. OK.

83118a23-6d66-4925-b924-e5b0b0054d83-0
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.260
So when she was when is on
Stacey's team, for what it's

83118a23-6d66-4925-b924-e5b0b0054d83-1
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.295
worth. Yeah. OK, thank you. So
then if she was in the same

83118a23-6d66-4925-b924-e5b0b0054d83-2
00:07:23.295 --> 00:07:27.741
warehouse, would that eliminate
the issue or would we still need

83118a23-6d66-4925-b924-e5b0b0054d83-3
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:31.640
to have it placed in dispatch
notes for Ellen and Trish?

5ee9d357-d229-482d-a693-353ec2ef9789-0
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.551
I am confused by that, that
she's not in the same warehouse.

5ee9d357-d229-482d-a693-353ec2ef9789-1
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:41.664
What does that mean exactly? I I
don't know if this is related. I

5ee9d357-d229-482d-a693-353ec2ef9789-2
00:07:41.664 --> 00:07:44.593
just know that she's on
different systems than

5ee9d357-d229-482d-a693-353ec2ef9789-3
00:07:44.593 --> 00:07:48.145
everybody. Like a marketing
warehouse. Yeah, it's it's a

5ee9d357-d229-482d-a693-353ec2ef9789-4
00:07:48.145 --> 00:07:51.448
marketing warehouse that's
different from what? Like

5ee9d357-d229-482d-a693-353ec2ef9789-5
00:07:51.448 --> 00:07:54.190
operations is in like her
inventory is not.

64c7721b-25ac-4f9c-9f91-64f0f56ca814-0
00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.225
Trackable, like everybody else,
is connected like everything

64c7721b-25ac-4f9c-9f91-64f0f56ca814-1
00:07:58.225 --> 00:08:01.629
else. So a lot of what she does
is manual. Everything she does

64c7721b-25ac-4f9c-9f91-64f0f56ca814-2
00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:02.170
is manual.

c180679c-2be6-4580-a96b-420066bbb360-0
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:08.219
OK, so I will say that I am
working with her, actually just

c180679c-2be6-4580-a96b-420066bbb360-1
00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:13.092
got off a call with her to try
to do some automation for

c180679c-2be6-4580-a96b-420066bbb360-2
00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:18.308
marketing Swatch fulfillment to
try to make it match more of

c180679c-2be6-4580-a96b-420066bbb360-3
00:08:18.308 --> 00:08:20.360
what is done for distro.

0b0df0d4-ec13-4539-93c5-937c0dd37af8-0
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.887
But where uh, we have, she was
telling me a lot of this. She

0b0df0d4-ec13-4539-93c5-937c0dd37af8-1
00:08:25.887 --> 00:08:30.302
takes paper down to you, Ellen,
a stats of paper and that you I

0b0df0d4-ec13-4539-93c5-937c0dd37af8-2
00:08:30.302 --> 00:08:34.303
think that's what you're
describing now. So we're looking

0b0df0d4-ec13-4539-93c5-937c0dd37af8-3
00:08:34.303 --> 00:08:38.717
to figure out how to eliminate
that scanning of barcodes on the

0b0df0d4-ec13-4539-93c5-937c0dd37af8-4
00:08:38.717 --> 00:08:42.718
pit tickets, Umm, and the
automatic creation of labels in

0b0df0d4-ec13-4539-93c5-937c0dd37af8-5
00:08:42.718 --> 00:08:46.857
two ship, would any of that
affect what we're talking about

0b0df0d4-ec13-4539-93c5-937c0dd37af8-6
00:08:46.857 --> 00:08:50.651
here? Would that be helpful or
not helpful? Completely

0b0df0d4-ec13-4539-93c5-937c0dd37af8-7
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:52.100
different wheelhouse.

bda39393-eb98-49f8-af9f-cb292414aabd-0
00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:00.668
Ohh, not certain. Not certain. I
don't know. Yeah. I mean, I

bda39393-eb98-49f8-af9f-cb292414aabd-1
00:09:00.668 --> 00:09:05.830
would think if it was, if it was
in dispatch notes, it would.

379d710e-c409-40c9-9a76-ee7362d57955-0
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.340
From every day, you know, just.

fdd6b24a-d817-4c42-9fb0-7e64dfbe458a-0
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.221
As they're entered like a
regular order instead of her

fdd6b24a-d817-4c42-9fb0-7e64dfbe458a-1
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:18.226
brain stacks of paperwork and
then and then she has to like

fdd6b24a-d817-4c42-9fb0-7e64dfbe458a-2
00:09:18.226 --> 00:09:21.230
manually type in the tracking
and stuff. So.

6ed17f06-3d2c-4ad9-9097-7bc94fc18cd9-0
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.760
For correct, yes.

aac9ef7d-afb7-4194-b6c3-5aab58aecdef-0
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.957
OK. And so it is. So then the
current issue is that because

aac9ef7d-afb7-4194-b6c3-5aab58aecdef-1
00:09:31.957 --> 00:09:36.024
her invoices are not in dispatch
notes, it would creates a lot of

aac9ef7d-afb7-4194-b6c3-5aab58aecdef-2
00:09:36.024 --> 00:09:39.290
manual work for Ellen and
Patricia. Is that correct?

7754dc72-af57-45c7-99d7-ec3c17342343-0
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.771
Which takes a lot of a lot of
extra time, slows productivity,

7754dc72-af57-45c7-99d7-ec3c17342343-1
00:09:44.771 --> 00:09:48.360
doesn't affect anyone else
besides the two of you.

5cf59bf1-4279-481d-9460-c176ee5c50af-0
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.236
I guess mostly me Trish don't
really do the marketing

5cf59bf1-4279-481d-9460-c176ee5c50af-1
00:09:54.236 --> 00:09:59.020
invoices. I only I only work on
those. If Miss Allen is out for

5cf59bf1-4279-481d-9460-c176ee5c50af-2
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.160
like a week on vacation or
something, OK.

2c2822e7-b219-4c21-9eb1-bd6ade1bbaf2-0
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:06.679
All right. So if we can get
those invoices fed into dispatch

2c2822e7-b219-4c21-9eb1-bd6ade1bbaf2-1
00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:09.430
notes and that eliminate the
need for paper.

a7bfae0c-ce1d-4e72-9f3d-85ced77497fc-0
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:14.257
For her physically bringing for
them, yes. And we understand

a7bfae0c-ce1d-4e72-9f3d-85ced77497fc-1
00:10:14.257 --> 00:10:18.528
that a lot of the issues because
Ellen currently has a marketing

a7bfae0c-ce1d-4e72-9f3d-85ced77497fc-2
00:10:18.528 --> 00:10:22.273
warehouse as opposed to what
everybody else is doing. So

a7bfae0c-ce1d-4e72-9f3d-85ced77497fc-3
00:10:22.273 --> 00:10:26.281
that's creating some issues in
the on the back end before it

a7bfae0c-ce1d-4e72-9f3d-85ced77497fc-4
00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:29.830
ever gets to to Ellen for what
she needs to do, yeah.

e5903950-40f5-4b8d-81b8-0d36736d7649-0
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.151
So that is that essentially is
the solution there. Is there

e5903950-40f5-4b8d-81b8-0d36736d7649-1
00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:38.953
anything else that needs to be
done in terms of getting the

e5903950-40f5-4b8d-81b8-0d36736d7649-2
00:10:38.953 --> 00:10:43.071
invoices into dispatch notes? Is
it just simply having them into

e5903950-40f5-4b8d-81b8-0d36736d7649-3
00:10:43.071 --> 00:10:46.809
dispatch notes as you receive
all the other invoices? Yes.

a593d6ea-17a8-4f69-88b8-abbc98cf9083-0
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:48.410
OK.

dca03e11-3e93-4be4-bf52-6be55186150c-0
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.960
No additional changes would need
to be done for those.

5b48d566-2875-471e-9d31-8c3fa6027d61-0
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:58.159
Well, I mean whatever the
process is for entering the

5b48d566-2875-471e-9d31-8c3fa6027d61-1
00:10:58.159 --> 00:11:03.094
shipping information, you know
like the FedEx number, tracking

5b48d566-2875-471e-9d31-8c3fa6027d61-2
00:11:03.094 --> 00:11:07.871
number and that would have to
happen also, but I assume that

5b48d566-2875-471e-9d31-8c3fa6027d61-3
00:11:07.871 --> 00:11:10.300
goes along with the process of.

81dca4fc-5161-42f7-9f1d-24d2838c9517-0
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.510
You know, getting them to
dispatch notes.

efaa3e84-3ad7-4cd5-a2a7-0fccf5a1fae6-0
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.650
Is that information that you
would need in dispatch notes?

9bb0e1f7-c3e7-443a-a036-70d0e0386673-0
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:29.397
Like yes, yes, but it's on all
the other invoices, so I would

9bb0e1f7-c3e7-443a-a036-70d0e0386673-1
00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:33.580
think that it would this would
be the same process.

1e3b3343-888a-43e6-85b9-e4be9635cab8-0
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:42.532
OK. So now how does that go
along with bins? I'm request to

1e3b3343-888a-43e6-85b9-e4be9635cab8-1
00:11:42.532 --> 00:11:47.969
make sure that we discuss all of
the, like the types of invoices,

1e3b3343-888a-43e6-85b9-e4be9635cab8-2
00:11:47.969 --> 00:11:53.076
what happens if it's prepaid,
Umm, if there's a deposit, how,

1e3b3343-888a-43e6-85b9-e4be9635cab8-3
00:11:53.076 --> 00:11:55.630
how does all of that correlate?

21836811-1267-43d8-a31c-abe31b614974-0
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.530
So where the automation we have
a lot of different.

c2cb633b-78f5-4c5d-9876-63a70d3b2382-0
00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:05.078
AR terms, OK. So if there's no
money on the order, say if it is

c2cb633b-78f5-4c5d-9876-63a70d3b2382-1
00:12:05.078 --> 00:12:09.545
a factored customer who factors
with one of our factor banks and

c2cb633b-78f5-4c5d-9876-63a70d3b2382-2
00:12:09.545 --> 00:12:14.013
they have net 30 times, then you
just invoice it. You just click

c2cb633b-78f5-4c5d-9876-63a70d3b2382-3
00:12:14.013 --> 00:12:18.274
invoice once you're in there and
and print it. That's all you

c2cb633b-78f5-4c5d-9876-63a70d3b2382-4
00:12:18.274 --> 00:12:22.672
have to do. Or if it's a A house
account with net 30 terms, you

c2cb633b-78f5-4c5d-9876-63a70d3b2382-5
00:12:22.672 --> 00:12:26.864
just print it. You don't have to
apply any money, there's no

c2cb633b-78f5-4c5d-9876-63a70d3b2382-6
00:12:26.864 --> 00:12:30.370
money there. But then with all
of our other terms.

bfc854bc-5818-4628-84cb-4f7e66fb1dea-0
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.407
If it's marked paid, um, and if
there's money on there, then you

bfc854bc-5818-4628-84cb-4f7e66fb1dea-1
00:12:34.407 --> 00:12:37.912
have to actually click take
payment and you have to apply

bfc854bc-5818-4628-84cb-4f7e66fb1dea-2
00:12:37.912 --> 00:12:41.840
the money. And I know one of his
questions he was saying is, you

bfc854bc-5818-4628-84cb-4f7e66fb1dea-3
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.110
know what happens if?

937fff4c-63ce-4021-8fb9-d5034e9ea878-0
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.994
If it's a little over or a
little under. So if if we're

937fff4c-63ce-4021-8fb9-d5034e9ea878-1
00:12:47.994 --> 00:12:51.963
split shipping their order and
it's a $10,000 order and we're

937fff4c-63ce-4021-8fb9-d5034e9ea878-2
00:12:51.963 --> 00:12:55.804
only shipping 5000, but that's
just for say they've paid in

937fff4c-63ce-4021-8fb9-d5034e9ea878-3
00:12:55.804 --> 00:12:59.836
full 10,000. We're only going to
invoice the amount that we're

937fff4c-63ce-4021-8fb9-d5034e9ea878-4
00:12:59.836 --> 00:13:03.869
shipping which is the 5000 and
the remaining 5000 stays on the

937fff4c-63ce-4021-8fb9-d5034e9ea878-5
00:13:03.869 --> 00:13:06.430
order as a deposit until we ship
again.

2b8625a0-4e40-496f-89a1-76b51a5d2aaa-0
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.150
And explain to me what is a
factor.

bb44a25c-3981-4046-9b43-c4e5945d11cb-0
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.021
It's, it's to me I just think of
it as like a a financial

bb44a25c-3981-4046-9b43-c4e5945d11cb-1
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:21.181
institution. It's it's it's a
bank they and they handle the

bb44a25c-3981-4046-9b43-c4e5945d11cb-2
00:13:21.181 --> 00:13:25.550
account and like if the customer
is slow to pay or doesn't pay

bb44a25c-3981-4046-9b43-c4e5945d11cb-3
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:29.294
then they they do the
collections and stuff. It's not

bb44a25c-3981-4046-9b43-c4e5945d11cb-4
00:13:29.294 --> 00:13:31.859
it's not our liability it's on
them.

0be3afde-6a66-45ed-ab50-3d6e7375351c-0
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.150
Like.

da513e35-9fdd-415c-9d9e-46ae5be685fd-0
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.650
I'm sure we paid them for the
customer.

725d4dd4-ac1f-4687-a980-d90b2debdc7e-0
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.864
It's Carla. Sorry I'm really
late on this meeting, but it's a

725d4dd4-ac1f-4687-a980-d90b2debdc7e-1
00:13:41.864 --> 00:13:45.227
credit line for the customer.
It's it's we have CIT and

725d4dd4-ac1f-4687-a980-d90b2debdc7e-2
00:13:45.227 --> 00:13:47.090
Rosenthal or the two wholesale.

ae7791b5-0b3a-4c3e-be10-6e8caa078f3c-0
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:52.349
Factor banks that we use factor
banks just what they're called,

ae7791b5-0b3a-4c3e-be10-6e8caa078f3c-1
00:13:52.349 --> 00:13:55.411
but anyways where we have
agreement they usually extend

ae7791b5-0b3a-4c3e-be10-6e8caa078f3c-2
00:13:55.411 --> 00:13:58.910
the net 30 terms to customer for
them to pay later versus a pre

ae7791b5-0b3a-4c3e-be10-6e8caa078f3c-3
00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:00.769
pay situation on other
customers.

00d846aa-8fec-42a1-b01e-039920668158-0
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.180
That's the two, you either get
the terms or the factor banks

00d846aa-8fec-42a1-b01e-039920668158-1
00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.556
where you've got your prepaid
customers, those two payment

00d846aa-8fec-42a1-b01e-039920668158-2
00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:08.900
types.

6478f64d-577b-4c06-b921-552abc5c3bd4-0
00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:10.240
OK.

dd06208b-039b-44d5-a10a-22e860bfedc5-0
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.760
OK. So then in terms of.

caa525ac-544c-4219-ac0a-349bd1891ee9-0
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:22.216
The automation from from that
side, is there anything else

caa525ac-544c-4219-ac0a-349bd1891ee9-1
00:14:22.216 --> 00:14:23.670
that we are missing?

3d8bb60b-80aa-4280-928e-63509e34ac24-0
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.630
Because it seemed as though.

a64dd7a3-2ad5-418d-b2ae-d64943a6172c-0
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:32.482
He was really looking for it
seemed like it would be much

a64dd7a3-2ad5-418d-b2ae-d64943a6172c-1
00:14:32.482 --> 00:14:36.552
more than just adding the
automation into the dispatch

a64dd7a3-2ad5-418d-b2ae-d64943a6172c-2
00:14:36.552 --> 00:14:40.770
notes. Does that take care of
deposit out everything for

a64dd7a3-2ad5-418d-b2ae-d64943a6172c-3
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.250
deposit application?

37817643-4001-4980-8619-1fd77e37fdf4-0
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.590
And invoice formatting.

bc9bad5a-4436-4b4e-ab18-b81d774e3465-0
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:53.222
Well, by deposit application you
remember, I mean do you mean

bc9bad5a-4436-4b4e-ab18-b81d774e3465-1
00:14:53.222 --> 00:14:58.084
when we actually received the
money, how that process is done

bc9bad5a-4436-4b4e-ab18-b81d774e3465-2
00:14:58.084 --> 00:15:03.025
I am assuming so unfortunately
he didn't elaborate for me, but

bc9bad5a-4436-4b4e-ab18-b81d774e3465-3
00:15:03.025 --> 00:15:08.045
I can definitely ask and ensure.
I was just gonna say it's just

bc9bad5a-4436-4b4e-ab18-b81d774e3465-4
00:15:08.045 --> 00:15:10.790
we received checks we received
we.

6872c5e0-551d-49e4-8615-107840d04b18-0
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.170
A lot of credit cards.

c76b0486-a8e1-4785-9bcd-09ce29d8a983-0
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:15.580
And.

afca3d26-d256-4987-9898-0f75334af207-0
00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:20.323
You know their the payments are
entered, however we receive

afca3d26-d256-4987-9898-0f75334af207-1
00:15:20.323 --> 00:15:24.377
them. You know, if we get a a
credit card payment, then you

afca3d26-d256-4987-9898-0f75334af207-2
00:15:24.377 --> 00:15:27.619
know that's centered on the
order we enter the.

5b43cf29-abac-4823-b36f-712a9567bba4-0
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:33.164
The payments on the order. If I
get a check then I enter that

5b43cf29-abac-4823-b36f-712a9567bba4-1
00:15:33.164 --> 00:15:34.450
check on the order.

2c11146b-0b03-45a8-bd3c-986da6a958c0-0
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.990
And then it stays on that order
until.

08705f0e-9dbc-4dc7-983e-9992a94b71b4-0
00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.440
Ohh we ship, we ship it.

3a34bcfb-7ed0-4959-ab9c-065796ea7773-0
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.229
Yeah, it's entered as a deposit
and it doesn't actually get

3a34bcfb-7ed0-4959-ab9c-065796ea7773-1
00:15:47.229 --> 00:15:48.970
applied until the invoicing.

7ff1f615-630f-475e-a059-71006c2745ea-0
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:54.107
So when when she invoices an
order, whatever was shipping,

7ff1f615-630f-475e-a059-71006c2745ea-1
00:15:54.107 --> 00:15:57.180
that's how much of the deposit
we apply to the order.

e978484f-979c-4b41-853f-cae8156e234f-0
00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:58.400
OK.

7331db26-1b3e-4c7a-832e-4dce58cf3a67-0
00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.130
And then Carla can probably
speak for.

121ae8a1-864e-422d-ab09-de60e7b733b9-0
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.750
The factoring part, because she
handles that end of.

cf7c9883-a87b-46cc-8919-c844269bb6bf-0
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.200
Ohh.

696b4a47-b890-4f9a-8bb4-201d0a5eb902-0
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.022
You know how there's already
automation set up in the

696b4a47-b890-4f9a-8bb4-201d0a5eb902-1
00:16:14.022 --> 00:16:17.161
beginning when we receive an
order for a customer that has

696b4a47-b890-4f9a-8bb4-201d0a5eb902-2
00:16:17.161 --> 00:16:17.640
approved?

cbdb651c-5c9b-4529-b103-1231e96c53bc-0
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.086
Credit line through one of the
factor banks, the orders, Chris

cbdb651c-5c9b-4529-b103-1231e96c53bc-1
00:16:22.086 --> 00:16:25.525
Nelson and Nazi helped me set
that up years ago where the

cbdb651c-5c9b-4529-b103-1231e96c53bc-2
00:16:25.525 --> 00:16:29.024
order will come in it like I
think it's four times or it's

cbdb651c-5c9b-4529-b103-1231e96c53bc-3
00:16:29.024 --> 00:16:32.819
it's upon every hour that orders
are submitted out kind of like

cbdb651c-5c9b-4529-b103-1231e96c53bc-4
00:16:32.819 --> 00:16:36.496
an EDI process to the factor
banks and their portal where the

cbdb651c-5c9b-4529-b103-1231e96c53bc-5
00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:39.876
water goes against that credit
line and they either gets

cbdb651c-5c9b-4529-b103-1231e96c53bc-6
00:16:39.876 --> 00:16:43.553
approved or denied. If like the
credit lines full or they are

cbdb651c-5c9b-4529-b103-1231e96c53bc-7
00:16:43.553 --> 00:16:46.756
past due, they'll deny or
decline the order for terms

cbdb651c-5c9b-4529-b103-1231e96c53bc-8
00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:48.120
until that's satisfied.

ec546897-0542-4d42-a2b7-c56fb6e1d2e0-0
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:51.593
Otherwise it comes right back in
within seconds or within the

ec546897-0542-4d42-a2b7-c56fb6e1d2e0-1
00:16:51.593 --> 00:16:54.756
hour. Just going to help you
know because there's a timing

ec546897-0542-4d42-a2b7-c56fb6e1d2e0-2
00:16:54.756 --> 00:16:58.080
issue in the system and it'll
credit approve it automatically

ec546897-0542-4d42-a2b7-c56fb6e1d2e0-3
00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.082
in our system. So the order just
flows straight through

ec546897-0542-4d42-a2b7-c56fb6e1d2e0-4
00:17:01.082 --> 00:17:04.459
accounting, it's approved, it
goes straight into production or

ec546897-0542-4d42-a2b7-c56fb6e1d2e0-5
00:17:04.459 --> 00:17:07.836
allocation. So there's that on
the front end. As far as the as

ec546897-0542-4d42-a2b7-c56fb6e1d2e0-6
00:17:07.836 --> 00:17:11.106
you're saying as far as the
invoicing and all and the reason

ec546897-0542-4d42-a2b7-c56fb6e1d2e0-7
00:17:11.106 --> 00:17:14.430
I think maybe Stacy and Eric is
with us from that perspective

ec546897-0542-4d42-a2b7-c56fb6e1d2e0-8
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.020
and Jackie?

c126699c-efe6-4d4e-a95c-12dae52c4a5f-0
00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:20.309
Are we talking about wanting to
get some kind of the look of the

c126699c-efe6-4d4e-a95c-12dae52c4a5f-1
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:24.671
invoices be approved by Jackie's
department as far as how they

c126699c-efe6-4d4e-a95c-12dae52c4a5f-2
00:17:24.671 --> 00:17:28.894
look when they go out to the
customer because on the IT side

c126699c-efe6-4d4e-a95c-12dae52c4a5f-3
00:17:28.894 --> 00:17:32.978
I'm not sure how that works
especially with oh, what's his

c126699c-efe6-4d4e-a95c-12dae52c4a5f-4
00:17:32.978 --> 00:17:37.132
name that just left us with
syspro. Your your contact Ellen

c126699c-efe6-4d4e-a95c-12dae52c4a5f-5
00:17:37.132 --> 00:17:41.078
that knew everything about
Syspro and helped you all the

c126699c-efe6-4d4e-a95c-12dae52c4a5f-6
00:17:41.078 --> 00:17:45.301
time. David Lang. David Lang I
think was the one who was got

c126699c-efe6-4d4e-a95c-12dae52c4a5f-7
00:17:45.301 --> 00:17:46.340
with a 30 yard.

5deb8b38-6949-441a-89a6-59353c117220-0
00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.565
This I know enough to be
dangerous with this, but got

5deb8b38-6949-441a-89a6-59353c117220-1
00:17:49.565 --> 00:17:53.117
with a third party to add say
our logo on to the invoices or

5deb8b38-6949-441a-89a6-59353c117220-2
00:17:53.117 --> 00:17:56.496
the look of the invoices. I
think it was a third party we

5deb8b38-6949-441a-89a6-59353c117220-3
00:17:56.496 --> 00:17:59.990
used Laurie, do you know that
portion of it what exactly we

5deb8b38-6949-441a-89a6-59353c117220-4
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.718
use for the look of our invoices
because right now they're very

5deb8b38-6949-441a-89a6-59353c117220-5
00:18:03.718 --> 00:18:07.329
inconsistent. I can tell you
that even on the licensees we've

5deb8b38-6949-441a-89a6-59353c117220-6
00:18:07.329 --> 00:18:10.998
got Gabby logo and unfortunately
it's all skewed, kind of wide

5deb8b38-6949-441a-89a6-59353c117220-7
00:18:10.998 --> 00:18:14.726
looking and looks very odd and
not very professional looking in

5deb8b38-6949-441a-89a6-59353c117220-8
00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:16.590
my opinion, but if we could get.

efa01ab0-12a4-44a8-9c27-b50660e7019c-0
00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:20.200
Especially for going with the
new logo and branding, we're

efa01ab0-12a4-44a8-9c27-b50660e7019c-1
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.740
just gonna need to make sure
that that's consistent across

efa01ab0-12a4-44a8-9c27-b50660e7019c-2
00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.400
the board for all the invoices
and my wrong on that, Stacey.

efa01ab0-12a4-44a8-9c27-b50660e7019c-3
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.060
Erica, as far as maybe that's
why you guys are involved or I

efa01ab0-12a4-44a8-9c27-b50660e7019c-4
00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.840
was just texting Erica and ask,
OK, what exactly we're on here

efa01ab0-12a4-44a8-9c27-b50660e7019c-5
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.080
for?

bd8dad77-0498-4a57-8b00-88ac1864b643-0
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.086
OK. Apparently so because, you
know, we're all about, we're

bd8dad77-0498-4a57-8b00-88ac1864b643-1
00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:44.772
about to change all the branding
anyway. Yeah. So yeah, this is

bd8dad77-0498-4a57-8b00-88ac1864b643-2
00:18:44.772 --> 00:18:48.171
the time to do it. And my
question for this is do you have

bd8dad77-0498-4a57-8b00-88ac1864b643-3
00:18:48.171 --> 00:18:51.224
separate Gabby invoices and
separate summer classics

bd8dad77-0498-4a57-8b00-88ac1864b643-4
00:18:51.224 --> 00:18:54.507
invoices? Are there invoices
that combine them both to a

bd8dad77-0498-4a57-8b00-88ac1864b643-5
00:18:54.507 --> 00:18:57.906
customer? We currently have
separate because we have those

bd8dad77-0498-4a57-8b00-88ac1864b643-6
00:18:57.906 --> 00:19:01.362
separated. However, it's my
understanding by the end of the

bd8dad77-0498-4a57-8b00-88ac1864b643-7
00:19:01.362 --> 00:19:04.703
year, 1st of next year, we're
going to the one branch for

bd8dad77-0498-4a57-8b00-88ac1864b643-8
00:19:04.703 --> 00:19:06.720
2:05, I think is the last I
heard.

550fb94f-9ac5-4fad-8958-164ff51e5040-0
00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.245
Was 270 at one point, but I
think it's 205. So we'll stick

550fb94f-9ac5-4fad-8958-164ff51e5040-1
00:19:10.245 --> 00:19:13.698
with that. And so then I guess
it will be whatever logo has

550fb94f-9ac5-4fad-8958-164ff51e5040-2
00:19:13.698 --> 00:19:17.209
been approved for that branding
that we'll need to make sure

550fb94f-9ac5-4fad-8958-164ff51e5040-3
00:19:17.209 --> 00:19:17.670
it's on.

ce3b39af-8b01-4990-b5b3-89c9029bd1ce-0
00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.864
All the invoices for you know,
wherever however that looks and

ce3b39af-8b01-4990-b5b3-89c9029bd1ce-1
00:19:22.864 --> 00:19:26.630
that it's, yeah, professional
looking there we go that way.

90dc0ffa-a4ba-473c-bca2-e22ccd31af0d-0
00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:32.080
Understanding because also
additionally, I understood that

90dc0ffa-a4ba-473c-bca2-e22ccd31af0d-1
00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.598
perhaps if somebody, some
customers may actually be

90dc0ffa-a4ba-473c-bca2-e22ccd31af0d-2
00:19:35.598 --> 00:19:39.724
getting multiple invoices and
emails a day. So we're looking

90dc0ffa-a4ba-473c-bca2-e22ccd31af0d-3
00:19:39.724 --> 00:19:43.714
to streamline that too. So
therefore we wouldn't want them

90dc0ffa-a4ba-473c-bca2-e22ccd31af0d-4
00:19:43.714 --> 00:19:47.841
to get 12 invoices here, here's
your invoice and then here's

90dc0ffa-a4ba-473c-bca2-e22ccd31af0d-5
00:19:47.841 --> 00:19:51.899
your invoice and then here's
your invoice. So instead of it

90dc0ffa-a4ba-473c-bca2-e22ccd31af0d-6
00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:56.025
being multiple, being all one
package, but ensuring that the

90dc0ffa-a4ba-473c-bca2-e22ccd31af0d-7
00:19:56.025 --> 00:19:58.190
branding is the most up to date.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.847
And current so I do not know if
marketing has a brand template

c0da8ff0-4617-498b-bb03-e8746be34bac-1
00:20:02.847 --> 00:20:07.070
that is used for emails or is
developing one, but that is

c0da8ff0-4617-498b-bb03-e8746be34bac-2
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:11.657
something that I would need or
need access to to include or or

c0da8ff0-4617-498b-bb03-e8746be34bac-3
00:20:11.657 --> 00:20:14.570
somehow denote within the
requirements.

4cd789e6-bd78-472d-b6be-8cbcdb17d17c-0
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.814
Yeah. So we have all new brand
guidelines. Um, they're both for

4cd789e6-bd78-472d-b6be-8cbcdb17d17c-1
00:20:18.814 --> 00:20:22.005
Gabby and some are classics. I
guess we need to figure out if

4cd789e6-bd78-472d-b6be-8cbcdb17d17c-2
00:20:22.005 --> 00:20:25.299
we're changing starting January
where they get one invoice from

4cd789e6-bd78-472d-b6be-8cbcdb17d17c-3
00:20:25.299 --> 00:20:28.181
both brands and then it'll
doesn't need to be Gabriella

4cd789e6-bd78-472d-b6be-8cbcdb17d17c-4
00:20:28.181 --> 00:20:31.321
White or does it need to have
both summer classics and Gabby

4cd789e6-bd78-472d-b6be-8cbcdb17d17c-5
00:20:31.321 --> 00:20:31.630
on it?

1bbb3b6b-8cd3-4d7c-b675-c9ff0f536103-0
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.720
What about contract?

ffe2a131-2be7-4590-86aa-d40c23e193c0-0
00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.555
Contract just goes to market as
summer classics and Gabby going

ffe2a131-2be7-4590-86aa-d40c23e193c0-1
00:20:38.555 --> 00:20:39.020
forward.

a9db055e-4e30-4b97-8481-48b94949a5f9-0
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.569
But they, they're their
customers are contracts. So, um,

a9db055e-4e30-4b97-8481-48b94949a5f9-1
00:20:45.569 --> 00:20:49.001
you know it, there's up for
discussion on whether Gabriella

a9db055e-4e30-4b97-8481-48b94949a5f9-2
00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:52.432
White just stays internal or
does everything switch that's,

a9db055e-4e30-4b97-8481-48b94949a5f9-3
00:20:52.432 --> 00:20:55.692
you know, accounting. HR is
going to switch to Gabriella

a9db055e-4e30-4b97-8481-48b94949a5f9-4
00:20:55.692 --> 00:20:59.238
White. So when you say where do
you work, you go to LinkedIn,

a9db055e-4e30-4b97-8481-48b94949a5f9-5
00:20:59.238 --> 00:21:02.841
it's supposed to be Gabriella
White, but nobody knows who that

a9db055e-4e30-4b97-8481-48b94949a5f9-6
00:21:02.841 --> 00:21:06.329
is. So it's kind of something we
need to figure out and talk

a9db055e-4e30-4b97-8481-48b94949a5f9-7
00:21:06.329 --> 00:21:09.589
through about invoicing and
accounting and all that. But

a9db055e-4e30-4b97-8481-48b94949a5f9-8
00:21:09.589 --> 00:21:11.820
yes, we do have e-mail templates
that.

19a927ce-3ecb-40cf-98a3-653db0ae0ede-0
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.150
Can be used for this.

206d4b22-92ab-4e16-9003-d9e247ec48af-0
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.373
That's perfect. Well, and the
thing that, Stephanie, I guess

206d4b22-92ab-4e16-9003-d9e247ec48af-1
00:21:17.373 --> 00:21:21.152
that needs to be noted somewhere
is that while it seems like it's

206d4b22-92ab-4e16-9003-d9e247ec48af-2
00:21:21.152 --> 00:21:24.588
all quiet, I just recently
learned that our licensees, they

206d4b22-92ab-4e16-9003-d9e247ec48af-3
00:21:24.588 --> 00:21:28.081
know when they have issues of
not receiving emails because I

206d4b22-92ab-4e16-9003-d9e247ec48af-4
00:21:28.081 --> 00:21:31.631
mean excuse me, invoices because
they're receiving the e-mail

206d4b22-92ab-4e16-9003-d9e247ec48af-5
00:21:31.631 --> 00:21:35.182
that something is shipped, but
then the invoice is not coming

206d4b22-92ab-4e16-9003-d9e247ec48af-6
00:21:35.182 --> 00:21:38.732
behind it. So it's almost like
a, it's a good thing sometimes

206d4b22-92ab-4e16-9003-d9e247ec48af-7
00:21:38.732 --> 00:21:42.283
because they're receiving both
even though it seems excessive

206d4b22-92ab-4e16-9003-d9e247ec48af-8
00:21:42.283 --> 00:21:44.230
because it's almost like a
check.

5b5bf12e-e887-4aae-930e-254171d8ac53-0
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.631
Hey I'm expecting an invoice
mail and oh here it is or oh I

5b5bf12e-e887-4aae-930e-254171d8ac53-1
00:21:47.631 --> 00:21:51.021
never received it so that they
can give us a heads up. I know

5b5bf12e-e887-4aae-930e-254171d8ac53-2
00:21:51.021 --> 00:21:54.357
that's happened a couple of
times with the licensees. That's

5b5bf12e-e887-4aae-930e-254171d8ac53-3
00:21:54.357 --> 00:21:57.748
the only examples I have because
they're the ones that's been

5b5bf12e-e887-4aae-930e-254171d8ac53-4
00:21:57.748 --> 00:22:01.139
vocal about it to say hey you
have. I know I'm supposed to be

5b5bf12e-e887-4aae-930e-254171d8ac53-5
00:22:01.139 --> 00:22:02.780
casual is the the main one he.

b0d37c1f-388f-4818-a7a9-c46b3542db6b-0
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.490
No, what's his name? Ericsson.

6d2a98ec-4b22-4265-87bb-c0b454f45b4e-0
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.802
Ben is his name Bill. No, Bruce
Bruce Erickson. That's always

6d2a98ec-4b22-4265-87bb-c0b454f45b4e-1
00:22:11.802 --> 00:22:15.309
get their names though. Yeah,
Bruce. Bruce there. He will give

6d2a98ec-4b22-4265-87bb-c0b454f45b4e-2
00:22:15.309 --> 00:22:18.595
us a heads up and say, hey, I
did receive an e-mail, but I

6d2a98ec-4b22-4265-87bb-c0b454f45b4e-3
00:22:18.595 --> 00:22:22.214
didn't get the invoice that came
behind it. So there's I guess a

6d2a98ec-4b22-4265-87bb-c0b454f45b4e-4
00:22:22.214 --> 00:22:25.666
fine line. It's it could be a
great check and balance, but at

6d2a98ec-4b22-4265-87bb-c0b454f45b4e-5
00:22:25.666 --> 00:22:28.673
the same time it may be
excessive for someone to say,

6d2a98ec-4b22-4265-87bb-c0b454f45b4e-6
00:22:28.673 --> 00:22:32.125
hey, I'm just getting e-mail
after e-mail after e-mail and to

6d2a98ec-4b22-4265-87bb-c0b454f45b4e-7
00:22:32.125 --> 00:22:35.354
the point where they're not
reading them and then they're

6d2a98ec-4b22-4265-87bb-c0b454f45b4e-8
00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:38.249
missing important information.
So I guess we could.

5557eb18-52cb-440b-8e0f-5478b6c2e035-0
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.470
Review that come separately.

08edff27-27be-474b-a098-b6bb5ed7bf1f-0
00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:45.784
And then an invoice comes, does
it come? That's what Ben told me

08edff27-27be-474b-a098-b6bb5ed7bf1f-1
00:22:45.784 --> 00:22:49.619
and that's been recent that they
give a heads up that hey, your

08edff27-27be-474b-a098-b6bb5ed7bf1f-2
00:22:49.619 --> 00:22:53.095
order is shipped and it gives
some information about that

08edff27-27be-474b-a098-b6bb5ed7bf1f-3
00:22:53.095 --> 00:22:56.750
shipment and that's an e-mail
that goes out automatically to

08edff27-27be-474b-a098-b6bb5ed7bf1f-4
00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.584
the customer and then of course
they received their invoice and

08edff27-27be-474b-a098-b6bb5ed7bf1f-5
00:23:00.584 --> 00:23:04.240
that could be two different
e-mail addresses as well. By the

08edff27-27be-474b-a098-b6bb5ed7bf1f-6
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.074
way, maybe accounting receives
the invoice whereas I don't know

08edff27-27be-474b-a098-b6bb5ed7bf1f-7
00:23:08.074 --> 00:23:11.789
purchaser or someone receives
the your order has shipped and.

0080d498-6917-4186-882c-7cea6e9f2fb0-0
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:15.105
It's on its way, but sometimes
they have both of those e-mail

0080d498-6917-4186-882c-7cea6e9f2fb0-1
00:23:15.105 --> 00:23:17.631
addresses the same in the
system. So it could be

0080d498-6917-4186-882c-7cea6e9f2fb0-2
00:23:17.631 --> 00:23:20.723
excessive. We're not going to
fix everything for everybody,

0080d498-6917-4186-882c-7cea6e9f2fb0-3
00:23:20.723 --> 00:23:23.919
but it would be something to
look at and say do we think it's

0080d498-6917-4186-882c-7cea6e9f2fb0-4
00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:26.960
excessive? Where could we cut
back some of the e-mail? You

0080d498-6917-4186-882c-7cea6e9f2fb0-5
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.001
know, just so we know that
what's going to the customer is

0080d498-6917-4186-882c-7cea6e9f2fb0-6
00:23:30.001 --> 00:23:33.094
the most important thing and
what they really need to know,

0080d498-6917-4186-882c-7cea6e9f2fb0-7
00:23:33.094 --> 00:23:36.444
so they don't ignore it. But at
the same time that it could be a

0080d498-6917-4186-882c-7cea6e9f2fb0-8
00:23:36.444 --> 00:23:38.300
good check and balance as well,
so.

a55a173f-8269-4a1f-9561-5ca84f4bba38-0
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:40.380
Both sides.

7f26a803-3afd-4ea5-8da0-2276abdf9c73-0
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.094
My question is, are they
duplicate emails and invoices or

7f26a803-3afd-4ea5-8da0-2276abdf9c73-1
00:23:45.094 --> 00:23:48.939
is it just because some
customers place so many orders

7f26a803-3afd-4ea5-8da0-2276abdf9c73-2
00:23:48.939 --> 00:23:53.273
and then each time we invoice,
that invoice is emailed out so

7f26a803-3afd-4ea5-8da0-2276abdf9c73-3
00:23:53.273 --> 00:23:55.930
they're getting 12 different
invoice?

5ad1c517-f67d-461a-ac6c-d9e21b60780c-0
00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:01.044
E-mail today, but they're not
duplicates. So like if we could

5ad1c517-f67d-461a-ac6c-d9e21b60780c-1
00:24:01.044 --> 00:24:05.222
wait and the system say, oh, all
twelve of these, go to this one

5ad1c517-f67d-461a-ac6c-d9e21b60780c-2
00:24:05.222 --> 00:24:09.143
e-mail and then shoot them in
one e-mail, is that what we're

5ad1c517-f67d-461a-ac6c-d9e21b60780c-3
00:24:09.143 --> 00:24:10.300
talking about? OK.

6d02c2e2-308d-4313-b76a-0bcd5a8ea8a9-0
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:16.567
That that that is what he, in
his initial estimate would

6d02c2e2-308d-4313-b76a-0bcd5a8ea8a9-1
00:24:16.567 --> 00:24:21.285
prefer. For instance, if someone
has ordered has 12 invoices,

6d02c2e2-308d-4313-b76a-0bcd5a8ea8a9-2
00:24:21.285 --> 00:24:25.622
then instead of them receiving
12 invoices, they get one

6d02c2e2-308d-4313-b76a-0bcd5a8ea8a9-3
00:24:25.622 --> 00:24:29.959
invoice with all 12 of the
actual PDF, etcetera attached

6d02c2e2-308d-4313-b76a-0bcd5a8ea8a9-4
00:24:29.959 --> 00:24:33.459
OK, one e-mail with all invoices
attached OK.

9ca6dff0-dc67-4fc3-a0c2-b4e8c86c3e71-0
00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.789
The separate your order has
shipped, that's new to me, so

9ca6dff0-dc67-4fc3-a0c2-b4e8c86c3e71-1
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:43.057
I'll make a note of that because
then I need to to discuss and

9ca6dff0-dc67-4fc3-a0c2-b4e8c86c3e71-2
00:24:43.057 --> 00:24:47.326
determine if that is something
that we would want to just have

9ca6dff0-dc67-4fc3-a0c2-b4e8c86c3e71-3
00:24:47.326 --> 00:24:51.323
the following orders have
shipped, if it's multiple to the

9ca6dff0-dc67-4fc3-a0c2-b4e8c86c3e71-4
00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:55.388
same and then the e-mail or
exactly how that would go. Does

9ca6dff0-dc67-4fc3-a0c2-b4e8c86c3e71-5
00:24:55.388 --> 00:24:59.046
anybody have any thoughts on
that? For instance if an

9ca6dff0-dc67-4fc3-a0c2-b4e8c86c3e71-6
00:24:59.046 --> 00:25:02.570
individual just received the
instead of getting 12?

c2f47dc1-732c-42d3-9ac5-136e00b1f3b6-0
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:08.045
Your order has shipped emails.
Would it be per uh? Would it be

c2f47dc1-732c-42d3-9ac5-136e00b1f3b6-1
00:25:08.045 --> 00:25:11.890
better to get one e-mail that
has all twelve of those

c2f47dc1-732c-42d3-9ac5-136e00b1f3b6-2
00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:16.375
particular shipped orders and
that information in one and then

c2f47dc1-732c-42d3-9ac5-136e00b1f3b6-3
00:25:16.375 --> 00:25:20.647
the separate one that includes
the 12 invoices for instance

c2f47dc1-732c-42d3-9ac5-136e00b1f3b6-4
00:25:20.647 --> 00:25:25.275
attached? I believe that is the
the the way that Ben is thinking

c2f47dc1-732c-42d3-9ac5-136e00b1f3b6-5
00:25:25.275 --> 00:25:26.130
about going.

a092bd08-29b6-4e0b-820d-7b724e79c78f-0
00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.693
One versus 12 for most people I
think would be better. I mean,

a092bd08-29b6-4e0b-820d-7b724e79c78f-1
00:25:31.693 --> 00:25:35.915
because everybody's inundated
with emails anyway, you know,

a092bd08-29b6-4e0b-820d-7b724e79c78f-2
00:25:35.915 --> 00:25:40.490
all day long. As a consumer, I'd
rather want e-mail saying, hey,

a092bd08-29b6-4e0b-820d-7b724e79c78f-3
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:44.431
these 12 orders shipped, and
then I e-mail saying, hey,

a092bd08-29b6-4e0b-820d-7b724e79c78f-4
00:25:44.431 --> 00:25:48.935
here's your 12 invoices instead
of 12 different emails with one

a092bd08-29b6-4e0b-820d-7b724e79c78f-5
00:25:48.935 --> 00:25:49.850
invoice each.

f5c90dbd-1c74-47ce-81a0-aea1c5934256-0
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.020
OK.

fdf57fc6-e10b-46bf-b350-85e1bfb4d70d-0
00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.288
Well, also let me throw out
there while we're talking about

fdf57fc6-e10b-46bf-b350-85e1bfb4d70d-1
00:25:57.288 --> 00:26:02.203
the invoice, the way our invoice
looks, you would not believe the

fdf57fc6-e10b-46bf-b350-85e1bfb4d70d-2
00:26:02.203 --> 00:26:06.821
number of people that pay it
twice or three times, or I don't

fdf57fc6-e10b-46bf-b350-85e1bfb4d70d-3
00:26:06.821 --> 00:26:10.992
know how many times I have
already, because at the very

fdf57fc6-e10b-46bf-b350-85e1bfb4d70d-4
00:26:10.992 --> 00:26:14.120
bottom of the invoice it's got
the total.

10721ea6-2799-4865-bf35-08321004dbdd-0
00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.940
Well, you know a lot of usually
when you receive an invoice, if

10721ea6-2799-4865-bf35-08321004dbdd-1
00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:22.990
you don't know anything it shows
zero at the bottom. But this

10721ea6-2799-4865-bf35-08321004dbdd-2
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.975
ours does not. Therefore when
they get our invoice, they pay

10721ea6-2799-4865-bf35-08321004dbdd-3
00:26:26.975 --> 00:26:30.894
it again, but they probably
already sent us a check they've

10721ea6-2799-4865-bf35-08321004dbdd-4
00:26:30.894 --> 00:26:32.920
already paid it on credit card.

51fb1e39-06a4-4b0e-9b10-3f0b43ff0d4f-0
00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:39.187
I mean, these customers,
evidently they they're not good

51fb1e39-06a4-4b0e-9b10-3f0b43ff0d4f-1
00:26:39.187 --> 00:26:45.177
bookkeepers. They don't mind
paying $12,000 invoices 2 times.

51fb1e39-06a4-4b0e-9b10-3f0b43ff0d4f-2
00:26:45.177 --> 00:26:45.950
They do.

cb622929-7be9-48c8-abba-882fec864e3f-0
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:51.100
Part of that you have the ones
who prepaid by credit card and

cb622929-7be9-48c8-abba-882fec864e3f-1
00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.689
then they're calling you saying,
hey, we already paid this

cb622929-7be9-48c8-abba-882fec864e3f-2
00:26:54.689 --> 00:26:58.399
invoice. Yes, you did. You don't
know it. It's just what I'm

cb622929-7be9-48c8-abba-882fec864e3f-3
00:26:58.399 --> 00:27:01.805
saying is that Daddy is a
problem. But, you know, we've

cb622929-7be9-48c8-abba-882fec864e3f-4
00:27:01.805 --> 00:27:05.576
just been told in the past that
they'll just have to and, you

cb622929-7be9-48c8-abba-882fec864e3f-5
00:27:05.576 --> 00:27:09.529
know, learn to live with it. And
if if they do, that's fine. But

cb622929-7be9-48c8-abba-882fec864e3f-6
00:27:09.529 --> 00:27:13.117
I'm just throwing it out there
because we're talking about

cb622929-7be9-48c8-abba-882fec864e3f-7
00:27:13.117 --> 00:27:15.489
changing things about the
invoice, so.

15e5b6c0-a88b-4386-89ca-a97e376c2c8b-0
00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.242
We need to revisit because what
I was told in the past, the

15e5b6c0-a88b-4386-89ca-a97e376c2c8b-1
00:27:20.242 --> 00:27:23.574
reason we couldn't do that was
because of all the different

15e5b6c0-a88b-4386-89ca-a97e376c2c8b-2
00:27:23.574 --> 00:27:26.907
payment types we take that it
would be correct for some but

15e5b6c0-a88b-4386-89ca-a97e376c2c8b-3
00:27:26.907 --> 00:27:30.183
not correct for others. For
instance, the ones who receive

15e5b6c0-a88b-4386-89ca-a97e376c2c8b-4
00:27:30.183 --> 00:27:33.738
terms, there's a payoff that we
do in the system to take it off

15e5b6c0-a88b-4386-89ca-a97e376c2c8b-5
00:27:33.738 --> 00:27:37.126
our books and put it on the
banks books. And if we're paying

15e5b6c0-a88b-4386-89ca-a97e376c2c8b-6
00:27:37.126 --> 00:27:40.347
off that but then sending
invoice that shows that you owe

15e5b6c0-a88b-4386-89ca-a97e376c2c8b-7
00:27:40.347 --> 00:27:43.790
$0.00 amount, they're not going
to pay it. So they still owe,

15e5b6c0-a88b-4386-89ca-a97e376c2c8b-8
00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:46.789
they just don't know us. They
owe the bank the money.

62b0b864-85fb-4b43-a87c-ba7027b6c795-0
00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:50.908
It's it's kind of complicated,
but it's still something we need

62b0b864-85fb-4b43-a87c-ba7027b6c795-1
00:27:50.908 --> 00:27:54.886
to revisit because I don't know
that that's 100%. I I feel like

62b0b864-85fb-4b43-a87c-ba7027b6c795-2
00:27:54.886 --> 00:27:58.616
there's a process somewhere or
the timing of things that we

62b0b864-85fb-4b43-a87c-ba7027b6c795-3
00:27:58.616 --> 00:28:02.159
could skirt around that and
satisfy the prepaids to show

62b0b864-85fb-4b43-a87c-ba7027b6c795-4
00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:06.013
that they've paid somehow. But
also I think Syspro 8 upgrade,

62b0b864-85fb-4b43-a87c-ba7027b6c795-5
00:28:06.013 --> 00:28:10.053
we were going to revisit that to
see if we gain any of that type

62b0b864-85fb-4b43-a87c-ba7027b6c795-6
00:28:10.053 --> 00:28:10.240
of.

449b38cc-67dc-4b13-b7ab-4af7b9d393b8-0
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.943
Love. Yeah be able to do it with
his probate. Is there any

449b38cc-67dc-4b13-b7ab-4af7b9d393b8-1
00:28:14.943 --> 00:28:18.824
changes coming with his probate
that would allow us to do that

449b38cc-67dc-4b13-b7ab-4af7b9d393b8-2
00:28:18.824 --> 00:28:22.334
as well and or something that
they've built in. So we're

449b38cc-67dc-4b13-b7ab-4af7b9d393b8-3
00:28:22.334 --> 00:28:26.153
definitely it's still on the
radar I think. But yes with this

449b38cc-67dc-4b13-b7ab-4af7b9d393b8-4
00:28:26.153 --> 00:28:29.787
we would want to relook at I
guess invoices in general how

449b38cc-67dc-4b13-b7ab-4af7b9d393b8-5
00:28:29.787 --> 00:28:33.606
they're generating out the look
of them making sure we've got

449b38cc-67dc-4b13-b7ab-4af7b9d393b8-6
00:28:33.606 --> 00:28:37.424
the right logo on it and that
that looks professional all the

449b38cc-67dc-4b13-b7ab-4af7b9d393b8-7
00:28:37.424 --> 00:28:40.935
above so we could look at
everything and Stephanie I can

449b38cc-67dc-4b13-b7ab-4af7b9d393b8-8
00:28:40.935 --> 00:28:41.490
send you.

11bbdd34-cdb1-43a3-a636-702f8825f22e-0
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.631
Some examples of what we're
talking about because it'd be

11bbdd34-cdb1-43a3-a636-702f8825f22e-1
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:49.903
easier to see than us just say,
hey, it looks crazy, This is

11bbdd34-cdb1-43a3-a636-702f8825f22e-2
00:28:49.903 --> 00:28:54.175
why, and this is what we're
talking about. So, so Stacey and

11bbdd34-cdb1-43a3-a636-702f8825f22e-3
00:28:54.175 --> 00:28:58.097
Erica, when will the new
marketing guidelines come out?

11bbdd34-cdb1-43a3-a636-702f8825f22e-4
00:28:58.097 --> 00:29:02.159
So I have the new guidelines
already. The internal launch

11bbdd34-cdb1-43a3-a636-702f8825f22e-5
00:29:02.159 --> 00:29:03.630
will be November 1st.

18d0dcf5-719e-4a19-9db0-d2893face303-0
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:10.825
Alright, cool. OK. All right. So
then just want to be sure. So in

18d0dcf5-719e-4a19-9db0-d2893face303-1
00:29:10.825 --> 00:29:11.610
terms of.

72a870cc-461f-4565-846f-b2ec1621cade-0
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:16.313
Automation for invoices for
wholesale. What needs to be done

72a870cc-461f-4565-846f-b2ec1621cade-1
00:29:16.313 --> 00:29:19.530
is that it needs to be added
into dispatch notes.

6e6bbd7c-1dcf-4d91-8844-652a6089253d-0
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:24.164
Is that correct? That's the
solution to the issue that we

6e6bbd7c-1dcf-4d91-8844-652a6089253d-1
00:29:24.164 --> 00:29:28.193
have for invoicing of automation
for wholesale. So anything

6e6bbd7c-1dcf-4d91-8844-652a6089253d-2
00:29:28.193 --> 00:29:32.020
that's just marketing, that's
just for marketing because

6e6bbd7c-1dcf-4d91-8844-652a6089253d-3
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:36.452
they're the only ones that don't
get entered into dispatch notes,

6e6bbd7c-1dcf-4d91-8844-652a6089253d-4
00:29:36.452 --> 00:29:40.280
right, and that's because of the
warehouse issue, right?

eb46d93c-e782-40d3-a06c-f735c1d8d9ed-0
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:45.900
Is there any automation for
invoices for wholesale? Because

eb46d93c-e782-40d3-a06c-f735c1d8d9ed-1
00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:50.488
wholesale is what he told me and
not marketing. Is he considering

eb46d93c-e782-40d3-a06c-f735c1d8d9ed-2
00:29:50.488 --> 00:29:54.937
it just means it's a warehouse,
it's a warehouse. So we invoice

eb46d93c-e782-40d3-a06c-f735c1d8d9ed-3
00:29:54.937 --> 00:29:59.525
out of a main warehouse or an MV
warehouse or marketing warehouse

eb46d93c-e782-40d3-a06c-f735c1d8d9ed-4
00:29:59.525 --> 00:30:03.904
to the warehouse determines not
the it's not wholesale per se.

eb46d93c-e782-40d3-a06c-f735c1d8d9ed-5
00:30:03.904 --> 00:30:07.658
We're invoicing out of
wholesale. It depends on where

eb46d93c-e782-40d3-a06c-f735c1d8d9ed-6
00:30:07.658 --> 00:30:11.689
the good is coming from if it's
in a marketing warehouse.

99b7f73d-88ba-4f98-a8ae-5e4e11bd25a3-0
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.226
That doesn't have the automation
associated with it to be able to

99b7f73d-88ba-4f98-a8ae-5e4e11bd25a3-1
00:30:16.226 --> 00:30:20.220
invoice the way we do in a
dispatch node. So it's probably

99b7f73d-88ba-4f98-a8ae-5e4e11bd25a3-2
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:24.348
an integration or coding issue
for that marketing warehouse.

99b7f73d-88ba-4f98-a8ae-5e4e11bd25a3-3
00:30:24.348 --> 00:30:28.477
OK, all right. It's just the
fact that he said wholesale. So

99b7f73d-88ba-4f98-a8ae-5e4e11bd25a3-4
00:30:28.477 --> 00:30:32.943
I want to make sure that because
we were talking about marketing,

99b7f73d-88ba-4f98-a8ae-5e4e11bd25a3-5
00:30:32.943 --> 00:30:37.410
alright. And then in addition to
that the marketing guidelines go

99b7f73d-88ba-4f98-a8ae-5e4e11bd25a3-6
00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:41.539
they are November 1st is the is
the date for those internal,

99b7f73d-88ba-4f98-a8ae-5e4e11bd25a3-7
00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:41.810
yes.

2f82ce33-c407-423c-95d6-20c06af04cc2-0
00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:46.463
OK. And then external sense, we
are talking about emails and the

2f82ce33-c407-423c-95d6-20c06af04cc2-1
00:30:46.463 --> 00:30:50.254
site, so we'll be going to
consumers. What is the launch

2f82ce33-c407-423c-95d6-20c06af04cc2-2
00:30:50.254 --> 00:30:54.445
date for that? We're combining
it with contracts, biggest show

2f82ce33-c407-423c-95d6-20c06af04cc2-3
00:30:54.445 --> 00:30:56.839
of the year which is November
12th.

abeba2aa-d832-453f-89db-bc7c491abafd-0
00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:02.509
Could be. And then in January,
we'll be out to all the

abeba2aa-d832-453f-89db-bc7c491abafd-1
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:07.014
consumers on the retail side,
OK. So I would assume that it

abeba2aa-d832-453f-89db-bc7c491abafd-2
00:31:07.014 --> 00:31:07.690
would be.

ea81f5e7-3f5c-4b22-8590-cd529cfdd648-0
00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.780
Would we need to differentiate
between?

676370e5-5257-40cb-b58c-bdfdaee6f73c-0
00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:18.789
In other words, do we need a a
launch of when we redesign this

676370e5-5257-40cb-b58c-bdfdaee6f73c-1
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:23.808
to go out November 12th and then
again January 1 to all of the

676370e5-5257-40cb-b58c-bdfdaee6f73c-2
00:31:23.808 --> 00:31:28.430
customers that are not BB? Is
that what would be desired?

43a3943d-aba4-49fe-ac30-56247a6d1e58-0
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:33.655
That the redesign emails for a
specific customer like how would

43a3943d-aba4-49fe-ac30-56247a6d1e58-1
00:31:33.655 --> 00:31:37.750
you want to handle that? Would
you just rather everything go

43a3943d-aba4-49fe-ac30-56247a6d1e58-2
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:41.777
January one? Well, if you're
doing well, we're only talking

43a3943d-aba4-49fe-ac30-56247a6d1e58-3
00:31:41.777 --> 00:31:44.060
about wholesale right now,
right?

2f35b98d-c40f-4e13-8145-a6d05920378e-0
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.420
Because like does the retail
side.

07688dcb-828e-443a-b1dc-69fbaf18715c-0
00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:53.598
I I don't know anything about
the accounting invoices and all

07688dcb-828e-443a-b1dc-69fbaf18715c-1
00:31:53.598 --> 00:31:57.775
of that. That's your realm. So
I, I, I don't know how that

07688dcb-828e-443a-b1dc-69fbaf18715c-2
00:31:57.775 --> 00:32:00.890
looks on the retail side like do
they have?

a92ca611-639f-4c21-9de3-14dbe6c60599-0
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:04.320
They just do their own
invoicing, right?

12e1d600-0d32-4be7-9b1d-b0c97a907bf9-0
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.110
You know the look of their
invoices or anything honestly,

12e1d600-0d32-4be7-9b1d-b0c97a907bf9-1
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.420
right?

68e5a2e0-cf18-4c53-a05a-19305d28bf89-0
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:13.988
Similar things. Have you ever
even seen the invoices? Like I

68e5a2e0-cf18-4c53-a05a-19305d28bf89-1
00:32:13.988 --> 00:32:17.057
don't think we know what the
invoices look like today. I have

68e5a2e0-cf18-4c53-a05a-19305d28bf89-2
00:32:17.057 --> 00:32:18.740
no idea what anything looks
like.

b177d630-cb94-4d05-829b-56f84b02f6c7-0
00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:24.268
Yeah, I can send you copies, uh
and I'll, I'll copy you Eric and

b177d630-cb94-4d05-829b-56f84b02f6c7-1
00:32:24.268 --> 00:32:28.405
Stacy when I send Stephanie as
far as what our wholesale

b177d630-cb94-4d05-829b-56f84b02f6c7-2
00:32:28.405 --> 00:32:30.220
invoices look like today.

8e019e30-5871-42af-9b6e-aa7fadcadb2a-0
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.864
And the uh and like I said,
Gabby's got their own essays,

8e019e30-5871-42af-9b6e-aa7fadcadb2a-1
00:32:34.864 --> 00:32:38.345
got their own, but then we've
got the 25260 branches, which is

8e019e30-5871-42af-9b6e-aa7fadcadb2a-2
00:32:38.345 --> 00:32:41.605
licensees and ecom and those
have a different look to them

8e019e30-5871-42af-9b6e-aa7fadcadb2a-3
00:32:41.605 --> 00:32:44.975
and those I'm not too happy
with. I would love your feedback

8e019e30-5871-42af-9b6e-aa7fadcadb2a-4
00:32:44.975 --> 00:32:47.130
on those as far as what we need
to do.

bcaa2dbd-5979-44bd-a370-88cec3422507-0
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:52.428
With the feather, no. They have
the Gabby logo, but it's

bcaa2dbd-5979-44bd-a370-88cec3422507-1
00:32:52.428 --> 00:32:56.839
outstretched wide and it's all
kind of crazy. Heart just broke.

bcaa2dbd-5979-44bd-a370-88cec3422507-2
00:32:56.839 --> 00:33:00.905
Yeah, I know. It is not proper
portions at all. Everything

bcaa2dbd-5979-44bd-a370-88cec3422507-3
00:33:00.905 --> 00:33:05.178
we've talked about today will be
that November date, November

bcaa2dbd-5979-44bd-a370-88cec3422507-4
00:33:05.178 --> 00:33:09.313
12th. Yeah. All of this is
business to business. Wholesale,

bcaa2dbd-5979-44bd-a370-88cec3422507-5
00:33:09.313 --> 00:33:13.379
contract like all of that
licensees can, they can, they're

bcaa2dbd-5979-44bd-a370-88cec3422507-6
00:33:13.379 --> 00:33:15.239
fine. Just let them switch.

da28bcc1-6a75-4d5f-9480-ac92106c2251-0
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:21.710
Yeah, yeah. They'll be informed
as a B2B customer. OK, perfect.

2230b98f-d492-48ad-8696-7789d551d030-0
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:25.877
Alright, So what I will do, and
I think you guys were about four

2230b98f-d492-48ad-8696-7789d551d030-1
00:33:25.877 --> 00:33:29.223
minutes over in one respect your
time, especially on a Friday

2230b98f-d492-48ad-8696-7789d551d030-2
00:33:29.223 --> 00:33:32.623
afternoon. What I'll do next is
I'm gonna write all of this up

2230b98f-d492-48ad-8696-7789d551d030-3
00:33:32.623 --> 00:33:35.860
into a requirements document and
then I will send it out to

2230b98f-d492-48ad-8696-7789d551d030-4
00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:39.044
everybody that was invited to
the call. You guys will have

2230b98f-d492-48ad-8696-7789d551d030-5
00:33:39.044 --> 00:33:42.498
edit access. I asked that you go
through it, make sure, keep me

2230b98f-d492-48ad-8696-7789d551d030-6
00:33:42.498 --> 00:33:46.006
honest, make sure that I notated
everything that we've discussed

2230b98f-d492-48ad-8696-7789d551d030-7
00:33:46.006 --> 00:33:49.082
and I have it written down
correctly and then we we will

2230b98f-d492-48ad-8696-7789d551d030-8
00:33:49.082 --> 00:33:52.320
reconvene after everybody had
the opportunity to put their.

e0c47606-1b51-4ad8-8ad7-956261ba2994-0
00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:56.896
And put into that document and
sure it up, make sure it looks

e0c47606-1b51-4ad8-8ad7-956261ba2994-1
00:33:56.896 --> 00:34:01.621
good and everything is good and
then once everybody approves and

e0c47606-1b51-4ad8-8ad7-956261ba2994-2
00:34:01.621 --> 00:34:05.982
signs off, then we'll send it
over to IT development for an

e0c47606-1b51-4ad8-8ad7-956261ba2994-3
00:34:05.982 --> 00:34:10.489
assignment to a developer at
that point. So does anybody have

e0c47606-1b51-4ad8-8ad7-956261ba2994-4
00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:14.778
any questions, Umm, anything
that I have missed? So if you

e0c47606-1b51-4ad8-8ad7-956261ba2994-5
00:34:14.778 --> 00:34:19.284
think of it now or at a later
date, please feel free to reach

e0c47606-1b51-4ad8-8ad7-956261ba2994-6
00:34:19.284 --> 00:34:23.210
out to me. e-mail, Umm, call I
am, it doesn't matter.

a7b9020f-8a18-4a41-b746-f0940c8ccc85-0
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:27.538
And I hope to be able to get
this document out by next week,

a7b9020f-8a18-4a41-b746-f0940c8ccc85-1
00:34:27.538 --> 00:34:31.144
but I'm having a lot of these
back-to-back meetings. So I may

a7b9020f-8a18-4a41-b746-f0940c8ccc85-2
00:34:31.144 --> 00:34:34.925
get delayed in getting out, but
that's my hope to have this base

a7b9020f-8a18-4a41-b746-f0940c8ccc85-3
00:34:34.925 --> 00:34:38.415
document out to everybody for
review units. Wait, does that

a7b9020f-8a18-4a41-b746-f0940c8ccc85-4
00:34:38.415 --> 00:34:40.510
sound good? Anything that I
missed?

dadd5c49-d811-4454-87ef-542881e13e8e-0
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.800
Anything that anybody remembers?

c97553d8-e109-408c-b97b-7bbd294a9472-0
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:44.520
No.

b62c1cc6-7c4f-4862-a039-92cd712a6c1a-0
00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.944
Alright. Well, thank you
everybody so much for joining me

b62c1cc6-7c4f-4862-a039-92cd712a6c1a-1
00:34:48.944 --> 00:34:52.983
this late in the day. Stephanie,
can I ask you a quick question?

b62c1cc6-7c4f-4862-a039-92cd712a6c1a-2
00:34:52.983 --> 00:34:57.021
So I didn't hear any talk about
like exception reporting. So I'm

b62c1cc6-7c4f-4862-a039-92cd712a6c1a-3
00:34:57.021 --> 00:35:00.563
assuming that once we get the
automation for the invoice

b62c1cc6-7c4f-4862-a039-92cd712a6c1a-4
00:35:00.563 --> 00:35:03.919
automation up and running,
there'll be some exception

b62c1cc6-7c4f-4862-a039-92cd712a6c1a-5
00:35:03.919 --> 00:35:08.020
reporting that we get so that we
know if there are any exceptions

b62c1cc6-7c4f-4862-a039-92cd712a6c1a-6
00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.500
that we need to work. In other
words, it didn't process

b62c1cc6-7c4f-4862-a039-92cd712a6c1a-7
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.110
correctly in the system. Is that
correct?

aaf2f9da-163d-4b39-9ffc-e65af0730794-0
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.430
Do you see those now?

5a97e305-3448-4a26-a72b-5917f23516f3-0
00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:20.904
Well, we do it manually now, so
we know at the time we're

5a97e305-3448-4a26-a72b-5917f23516f3-1
00:35:20.904 --> 00:35:24.597
invoicing whether right, we know
whether it goes through or not.

5a97e305-3448-4a26-a72b-5917f23516f3-2
00:35:24.597 --> 00:35:28.062
If there's an error that we
because we do it manually, we we

5a97e305-3448-4a26-a72b-5917f23516f3-3
00:35:28.062 --> 00:35:31.187
know that there's an issue at
the time we're trying to

5a97e305-3448-4a26-a72b-5917f23516f3-4
00:35:31.187 --> 00:35:32.380
generate the invoice.

8f97c114-b9d6-48cc-b7e7-6f0c83bce926-0
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:36.279
But the question would be if
this is automated, we we need to

8f97c114-b9d6-48cc-b7e7-6f0c83bce926-1
00:35:36.279 --> 00:35:39.267
have some way to know if
something errors out and we can

8f97c114-b9d6-48cc-b7e7-6f0c83bce926-2
00:35:39.267 --> 00:35:40.840
go in and work that exception.

29cb8ff5-3c4c-4489-9c45-7bce2b997454-0
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.050
OK. I would have to assume that
would be part of it, but.

13034d33-f6f1-4cbf-9014-52367192e06c-0
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:49.957
I'll make it a note in the
requirement so that it will be a

13034d33-f6f1-4cbf-9014-52367192e06c-1
00:35:49.957 --> 00:35:53.524
part of it. There any specific
types of exceptions that you

13034d33-f6f1-4cbf-9014-52367192e06c-2
00:35:53.524 --> 00:35:57.330
would want to receive? Um, let
me know. Or is it that you just?

4dde88dc-6d88-41c4-a54d-71b08d72dc67-0
00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:03.192
All exceptions, anything where
it doesn't invoice out because

4dde88dc-6d88-41c4-a54d-71b08d72dc67-1
00:36:03.192 --> 00:36:07.314
this is the stage, you know, an
invoice is where we generate the

4dde88dc-6d88-41c4-a54d-71b08d72dc67-2
00:36:07.314 --> 00:36:11.437
revenue. So we're going to want
to know if they're issues in one

4dde88dc-6d88-41c4-a54d-71b08d72dc67-3
00:36:11.437 --> 00:36:13.150
report or separate reports.

a4f36303-8a55-4205-8b90-fbc786feb249-0
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:19.159
I don't know why it would need
to be a separate report, I would

a4f36303-8a55-4205-8b90-fbc786feb249-1
00:36:19.159 --> 00:36:20.990
just say an exception report.

496d86ec-87d6-4ade-9c04-b2d4f3bb8b3e-0
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:27.561
And obviously we would want to
try to pinpoint what's creating

496d86ec-87d6-4ade-9c04-b2d4f3bb8b3e-1
00:36:27.561 --> 00:36:32.057
the exception. So I, you know, I
don't know what that looks like,

496d86ec-87d6-4ade-9c04-b2d4f3bb8b3e-2
00:36:32.057 --> 00:36:32.329
but.

95463077-459e-4753-8a6c-31c3766afe70-0
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:38.280
Maybe there's not enough money
on the, you know, the.

44048c2d-9626-432d-bb5c-7d30b925b838-0
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:43.867
On the order at the end of the
day to invoice out whatever that

44048c2d-9626-432d-bb5c-7d30b925b838-1
00:36:43.867 --> 00:36:47.762
looks like. And since she said
that when we're applying a

44048c2d-9626-432d-bb5c-7d30b925b838-2
00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:52.060
deposit, if we're shipping out
an invoicing out more money more

44048c2d-9626-432d-bb5c-7d30b925b838-3
00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:56.492
than what we have on deposit, we
have to apply the deposit amount

44048c2d-9626-432d-bb5c-7d30b925b838-4
00:36:56.492 --> 00:37:00.589
that we do have and then the
excess we put it on the account

44048c2d-9626-432d-bb5c-7d30b925b838-5
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:04.954
as a balance due. So automation
would need to know that that has

44048c2d-9626-432d-bb5c-7d30b925b838-6
00:37:04.954 --> 00:37:06.230
to be done as well.

5ac0de16-5585-418d-aff8-9d8bff6112dc-0
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:09.940
Right, otherwise it would create
an exception.

daf4980a-c4f9-4ddd-a5c2-17e9b77b1723-0
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.960
Um, if there's more money on the
order than what we invoice out.

78c0ae6b-5259-4f1b-bbed-0d906ca13d65-0
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:18.050
No, no. If there's not enough,
not enough.

cbcaf39b-4e8d-458a-aabc-ea2e01e31dde-0
00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.091
Yeah. Yeah. The question would
be, would it let us invoice out

cbcaf39b-4e8d-458a-aabc-ea2e01e31dde-1
00:37:24.091 --> 00:37:27.819
and apply what we have and just
leave an open balance on the

cbcaf39b-4e8d-458a-aabc-ea2e01e31dde-2
00:37:27.819 --> 00:37:28.370
customer.

7121fee8-cea1-4198-81a7-767d2c0d8d3b-0
00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:30.300
Yeah.

0c91e111-49e6-4238-8ca4-4895a830c396-0
00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:34.873
So basically I would invoice it
out and it should invoice it

0c91e111-49e6-4238-8ca4-4895a830c396-1
00:37:34.873 --> 00:37:37.600
out. I would think apply
whatever monies are there and

0c91e111-49e6-4238-8ca4-4895a830c396-2
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.673
then it leaves an open balance
on the customer. I wouldn't, I

0c91e111-49e6-4238-8ca4-4895a830c396-3
00:37:40.673 --> 00:37:43.845
wouldn't think that would error
out. We would just have to work

0c91e111-49e6-4238-8ca4-4895a830c396-4
00:37:43.845 --> 00:37:46.820
our AR trial balance and make
sure we keep that cleaned up.

70ab1ed3-54c9-48a3-890d-362b00ec1cbf-0
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.967
Right, but and but now when
we're invoicing, if we're

70ab1ed3-54c9-48a3-890d-362b00ec1cbf-1
00:37:52.967 --> 00:37:57.643
invoicing with $1000 and they
only have 500 on the account, we

70ab1ed3-54c9-48a3-890d-362b00ec1cbf-2
00:37:57.643 --> 00:38:01.947
apply the 500, close out of that
screen go and to put the

70ab1ed3-54c9-48a3-890d-362b00ec1cbf-3
00:38:01.947 --> 00:38:04.100
remaining 500 on the account.

d10fac5b-a4ab-4f92-8670-b02c88ee6677-0
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:11.255
As a balance due and then we
work the aging, but yeah, so I

d10fac5b-a4ab-4f92-8670-b02c88ee6677-1
00:38:11.255 --> 00:38:13.230
guess with automation.

fabba1bf-e3e2-4e47-b9d1-22efa932a16c-0
00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.000
It would need to do that also.

86b028f5-b34d-4eaf-8873-dcd70d8e6994-0
00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:22.982
I guess I'm just assuming it's a
seamless process. I go into

86b028f5-b34d-4eaf-8873-dcd70d8e6994-1
00:38:22.982 --> 00:38:26.929
invoice, I've got $1000 order
that I need to invoice out. I've

86b028f5-b34d-4eaf-8873-dcd70d8e6994-2
00:38:26.929 --> 00:38:30.626
got $500.00 on deposit. I
invoice it out, take the $500.00

86b028f5-b34d-4eaf-8873-dcd70d8e6994-3
00:38:30.626 --> 00:38:34.511
deposit, and then the balance as
part of that process is just

86b028f5-b34d-4eaf-8873-dcd70d8e6994-4
00:38:34.511 --> 00:38:38.020
kind of a seamless process. It
just puts $500.00 on the

86b028f5-b34d-4eaf-8873-dcd70d8e6994-5
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:42.156
customer account, but it's still
invoices a customer out and then

86b028f5-b34d-4eaf-8873-dcd70d8e6994-6
00:38:42.156 --> 00:38:45.978
we have to go back and collect
those funds. I hope we're not

86b028f5-b34d-4eaf-8873-dcd70d8e6994-7
00:38:45.978 --> 00:38:49.549
doing a lot of that, but I guess
that's always possible.

10543f0d-99fa-490e-84b3-89702a357245-0
00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.969
Maybe something got changed and
we didn't know and they didn't

10543f0d-99fa-490e-84b3-89702a357245-1
00:38:52.969 --> 00:38:56.229
know. We didn't know to go get
the additional deposit, whatever

10543f0d-99fa-490e-84b3-89702a357245-2
00:38:56.229 --> 00:38:59.183
it may be, but I wouldn't,
Carla, do you know, I wouldn't

10543f0d-99fa-490e-84b3-89702a357245-3
00:38:59.183 --> 00:39:00.610
think that would air it out.

8821ffc9-649f-4ad1-8b51-55efbbabe8db-0
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:06.626
No, I wouldn't think. I wouldn't
think it would keep it from

8821ffc9-649f-4ad1-8b51-55efbbabe8db-1
00:39:06.626 --> 00:39:10.304
being invoiced. No, it would
just, I hear what Trish is

8821ffc9-649f-4ad1-8b51-55efbbabe8db-2
00:39:10.304 --> 00:39:14.376
saying. It just needs to know
the system or whatever needs to

8821ffc9-649f-4ad1-8b51-55efbbabe8db-3
00:39:14.376 --> 00:39:15.689
know that. Yeah, it.

96c59808-1a64-43bf-b4e0-653498214f04-0
00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:20.003
There's still a balance to be
collected and that goes on the

96c59808-1a64-43bf-b4e0-653498214f04-1
00:39:20.003 --> 00:39:23.082
account, but we do run those
balance with invoices with

96c59808-1a64-43bf-b4e0-653498214f04-2
00:39:23.082 --> 00:39:26.546
balance due report that catches
those. And if we're doing that

96c59808-1a64-43bf-b4e0-653498214f04-3
00:39:26.546 --> 00:39:30.065
timely, we should be able to in
the moment go in and charge the

96c59808-1a64-43bf-b4e0-653498214f04-4
00:39:30.065 --> 00:39:33.364
customer and all as well. So
it's just an additional charge

96c59808-1a64-43bf-b4e0-653498214f04-5
00:39:33.364 --> 00:39:36.663
like it would have been had we
caught it before. Your point

96c59808-1a64-43bf-b4e0-653498214f04-6
00:39:36.663 --> 00:39:39.907
though, Trish, I think it you I
think you're exactly right

96c59808-1a64-43bf-b4e0-653498214f04-7
00:39:39.907 --> 00:39:43.041
though we probably want it to
flag it so we can pinpoint

96c59808-1a64-43bf-b4e0-653498214f04-8
00:39:43.041 --> 00:39:46.450
immediately where we need to go
in and collect the additional

96c59808-1a64-43bf-b4e0-653498214f04-9
00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:46.780
funds.

3894a5ee-e8c5-4660-83d5-c2a5ecf71ff4-0
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:51.920
So it I I think you're I think
you're exactly right it's.

79dcd1d0-362b-467d-b76c-1eef3353cd8e-0
00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:56.595
It shouldn't air out but it it
probably is something that we

79dcd1d0-362b-467d-b76c-1eef3353cd8e-1
00:39:56.595 --> 00:40:00.387
need to be aware of so we can
pinpoint it and go in and get

79dcd1d0-362b-467d-b76c-1eef3353cd8e-2
00:40:00.387 --> 00:40:04.433
the additional funds. We should
be able to run that balance due

79dcd1d0-362b-467d-b76c-1eef3353cd8e-3
00:40:04.433 --> 00:40:08.541
report and then it have today's
like all of 97 you know this was

79dcd1d0-362b-467d-b76c-1eef3353cd8e-4
00:40:08.541 --> 00:40:12.586
what came through or like yeah
either way we can add that in to

79dcd1d0-362b-467d-b76c-1eef3353cd8e-5
00:40:12.586 --> 00:40:15.810
the to the report. So an
exception Yep definitely.

44f6504b-a916-484d-a30c-2335cb508e7f-0
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:19.994
So something like that would be
would need to be added to the

44f6504b-a916-484d-a30c-2335cb508e7f-1
00:40:19.994 --> 00:40:21.880
balance to report which you
already have.

53658238-6f74-4660-be1a-0335044fab9a-0
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.122
It's already there. We have, we
have it. No, not balance due.

53658238-6f74-4660-be1a-0335044fab9a-1
00:40:27.122 --> 00:40:30.170
It's a different report. We
haven't discussed that one you

53658238-6f74-4660-be1a-0335044fab9a-2
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:33.011
and I before. It's a different
report. That is another

53658238-6f74-4660-be1a-0335044fab9a-3
00:40:33.011 --> 00:40:36.265
exception report we run daily
that just shows us invoices with

53658238-6f74-4660-be1a-0335044fab9a-4
00:40:36.265 --> 00:40:39.158
balances have either credit
balances or balances due on

53658238-6f74-4660-be1a-0335044fab9a-5
00:40:39.158 --> 00:40:42.309
them. But that's it's usually
orders that have terms that is

53658238-6f74-4660-be1a-0335044fab9a-6
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:45.253
an exception report. It
shouldn't have gone out the door

53658238-6f74-4660-be1a-0335044fab9a-7
00:40:45.253 --> 00:40:48.352
without the money, but for some
reason it did. And so we're

53658238-6f74-4660-be1a-0335044fab9a-8
00:40:48.352 --> 00:40:51.607
working that to make sure we're
collecting that money where we

53658238-6f74-4660-be1a-0335044fab9a-9
00:40:51.607 --> 00:40:53.880
failed to do so. Sometimes it's
just stuff.

ccf99d52-a9da-4643-a722-d29a4079e5ab-0
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.773
Added to the order Freight's
been added. Another line item

ccf99d52-a9da-4643-a722-d29a4079e5ab-1
00:40:56.773 --> 00:40:59.645
was added after we had paid it
in full, and we just weren't

ccf99d52-a9da-4643-a722-d29a4079e5ab-2
00:40:59.645 --> 00:41:02.612
aware in accounting that that
was the case and so it went out

ccf99d52-a9da-4643-a722-d29a4079e5ab-3
00:41:02.612 --> 00:41:04.670
the door without that money
collected, so.

85cd5546-f429-4f7b-9652-1d2c4b77f19f-0
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.110
OK.

220acaf8-7a94-457e-8c23-75bd2359c703-0
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.810
Alright.

26af8d55-372c-4abc-9774-e000f816be54-0
00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:11.963
Well, I think I have everything
I need to get the base

26af8d55-372c-4abc-9774-e000f816be54-1
00:41:11.963 --> 00:41:15.418
requirements document put
together and then I'll get it

26af8d55-372c-4abc-9774-e000f816be54-2
00:41:15.418 --> 00:41:18.379
sent out to you guys and we will
go from there.

ba4e94af-be51-4a8f-b2ac-126b48dbd517-0
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.361
OK. Do you have anything else?
Feel free to reach out to me.

ba4e94af-be51-4a8f-b2ac-126b48dbd517-1
00:41:23.361 --> 00:41:27.307
Thank you so much for your time.
Have a good afternoon. Thank

ba4e94af-be51-4a8f-b2ac-126b48dbd517-2
00:41:27.307 --> 00:41:29.280
you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
