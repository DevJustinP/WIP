00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.318
Happy New Year to you all. Ohh
thank you. You too. I haven't

8cc9a371-b844-4670-9c7e-22cf0218790d-1
00:00:08.318 --> 00:00:11.920
spoken to or seen you guys. I've
talked to Justin.

fa17703f-9027-4259-8245-9c22375cd2b0-0
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.410
Times Now.

68e9c54c-48b3-4530-b992-3623b9f86ca0-0
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.280
You were waiting on her. You.

5fbf617f-3d36-41df-bbfa-59da5baf8def-0
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.220
More people.

f6581416-d574-4018-ae28-30af2fde5a9e-0
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.094
Everyone except it. Except for
Laurie, so we'll give him a

f6581416-d574-4018-ae28-30af2fde5a9e-1
00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:31.560
second.

7f1cd56c-320c-4132-81b6-3beec4f10610-0
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.519
Lori's not going to be joining
us. Yeah, I figured as much. She

7f1cd56c-320c-4132-81b6-3beec4f10610-1
00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:39.550
didn't accept so.

18a9345c-dd46-4ecb-8992-c4e9c7359b1c-0
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.225
We're still missing Carla.
Carla. Yeah. So give her a

18a9345c-dd46-4ecb-8992-c4e9c7359b1c-1
00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:46.890
second.

b7631f02-0cdb-4a53-90dc-cae3772e3bc8-0
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.147
This. I think she's the only one
we're missing. Ohh. OK, well, I

b7631f02-0cdb-4a53-90dc-cae3772e3bc8-1
00:00:53.147 --> 00:00:57.281
know she's planning on joining
us. I talked to her earlier.

b7631f02-0cdb-4a53-90dc-cae3772e3bc8-2
00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:58.590
Yeah, OK good deal.

b4569ce0-b661-46c5-945d-9f8950c4c7e3-0
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.910
Just a second. Maybe she's
running back.

2cf52709-d6ad-4419-bded-4ef832e205a4-0
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.710
At this point.

7c4e7d0f-8dbc-4e8b-8782-368781e0f70e-0
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:28.750


cc142390-561b-4c82-8f36-607d2fc4a7d7-0
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.990
Yeah, what's your name?

10c4d154-b71f-475e-addb-1fa36b5fcbcd-0
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.280
There she is.

51b5474a-4b01-463a-b8a0-add1fc673166-0
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.136
Gosh, apparently my mic's not on
either. I was on the phone call

51b5474a-4b01-463a-b8a0-add1fc673166-1
00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:08.740
with her collection agency when
I said yeah, alright.

ac9d6c9b-1126-4be4-90be-10177b841835-0
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.216
And the gangs all here, um,
guess we will go ahead and get

ac9d6c9b-1126-4be4-90be-10177b841835-1
00:02:15.216 --> 00:02:19.718
started. So this meeting was
pretty much called because now

ac9d6c9b-1126-4be4-90be-10177b841835-2
00:02:19.718 --> 00:02:23.544
we have a developer Justin
assigned to the invoice

ac9d6c9b-1126-4be4-90be-10177b841835-3
00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:28.271
automation project and he and I
met briefly he had a couple of

ac9d6c9b-1126-4be4-90be-10177b841835-4
00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:32.172
questions. Initially our
conversations as a team to

ac9d6c9b-1126-4be4-90be-10177b841835-5
00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:36.749
develop the requirements was
extremely high level and so now

ac9d6c9b-1126-4be4-90be-10177b841835-6
00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:38.249
in order for him to.

78259d05-7982-4c3a-adeb-8d4a072d114f-0
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.440
Start doing the development
work. He needs a little more

78259d05-7982-4c3a-adeb-8d4a072d114f-1
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.199
detail, so he asked that we all
get together really define the

78259d05-7982-4c3a-adeb-8d4a072d114f-2
00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.421
project scope. He had a few
questions about that. For

78259d05-7982-4c3a-adeb-8d4a072d114f-3
00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:52.941
instance, as I included in the
meeting notice, he asked me

78259d05-7982-4c3a-adeb-8d4a072d114f-4
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:56.222
whether or not we want to
automate all of the invoices

78259d05-7982-4c3a-adeb-8d4a072d114f-5
00:02:56.222 --> 00:02:59.862
that are coming through, or if
we're really just focusing on

78259d05-7982-4c3a-adeb-8d4a072d114f-6
00:02:59.862 --> 00:03:03.382
fabric sample orders, which is
what the invoice automation

78259d05-7982-4c3a-adeb-8d4a072d114f-7
00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:07.200
requirements document addresses.
And then he also would like to

78259d05-7982-4c3a-adeb-8d4a072d114f-8
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.050
get a good demo of the current.

73aaa035-8e3e-4924-8323-d44c21b61fd3-0
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.868
Invoice process really trying to
understand the current state so

73aaa035-8e3e-4924-8323-d44c21b61fd3-1
00:03:13.868 --> 00:03:18.460
that then we can push forward
towards that future state. So he

73aaa035-8e3e-4924-8323-d44c21b61fd3-2
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.907
asked them questions like how
was the normal order invoiced,

73aaa035-8e3e-4924-8323-d44c21b61fd3-3
00:03:22.907 --> 00:03:27.645
when is the invoice created? And
then you know what really needs

73aaa035-8e3e-4924-8323-d44c21b61fd3-4
00:03:27.645 --> 00:03:32.018
to fully happen in order to
create that invoice. So I think

73aaa035-8e3e-4924-8323-d44c21b61fd3-5
00:03:32.018 --> 00:03:36.465
maybe Justin, would you like to
start with the current state

73aaa035-8e3e-4924-8323-d44c21b61fd3-6
00:03:36.465 --> 00:03:36.829
demo?

c8e426ed-c465-4f34-9676-4a3eebf7800b-0
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.035
Or do you wanna start talk about
project scope? What works best?

c8e426ed-c465-4f34-9676-4a3eebf7800b-1
00:03:41.035 --> 00:03:44.440
I will start with the demo just
to see if maybe that drives some

c8e426ed-c465-4f34-9676-4a3eebf7800b-2
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.960
additional questions for you.

719d1010-0f06-4d60-9a17-ef3c7c3f62da-0
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.360
That is what I would suggest.

0be31b2f-10a7-4d12-8aee-718a9a543475-0
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.683
OK. Or rather a discussion, I'm
not really sure if you there's

0be31b2f-10a7-4d12-8aee-718a9a543475-1
00:03:53.683 --> 00:03:58.318
much you guys can demo like all
the way through. But if you can

0be31b2f-10a7-4d12-8aee-718a9a543475-2
00:03:58.318 --> 00:04:02.447
kind of walk us through in him
and and as much detail as

0be31b2f-10a7-4d12-8aee-718a9a543475-3
00:04:02.447 --> 00:04:06.793
possible showing the screens
that you have available to you

0be31b2f-10a7-4d12-8aee-718a9a543475-4
00:04:06.793 --> 00:04:11.574
and any samples of anything that
you currently have like invoices

0be31b2f-10a7-4d12-8aee-718a9a543475-5
00:04:11.574 --> 00:04:15.702
etcetera of what the process is
for an invoice once it's

0be31b2f-10a7-4d12-8aee-718a9a543475-6
00:04:15.702 --> 00:04:18.599
received and then how it walks
through?

39dda39a-2904-4495-8b7b-9a38e4f6012a-0
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.671
I'll jump in real quick just to
kind of maybe define some of

39dda39a-2904-4495-8b7b-9a38e4f6012a-1
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:26.350
this before we show you demo.

eb7c03ae-2860-441a-88be-a9609b0e1673-0
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.017
I know that the scope is
currently written up for the

eb7c03ae-2860-441a-88be-a9609b0e1673-1
00:04:31.017 --> 00:04:34.080
fabric samples and that for sure
needs to happen.

b7a2ddf2-d25b-4ce8-8183-8b08fa5adba4-0
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.569
The only other thing that I'm
aware of that we might could

b7a2ddf2-d25b-4ce8-8183-8b08fa5adba4-1
00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:43.896
automate at this time and I say
automating that I'm seeing this

b7a2ddf2-d25b-4ce8-8183-8b08fa5adba4-2
00:04:43.896 --> 00:04:48.291
loosely. The one thing we don't
do that I know syspro is capable

b7a2ddf2-d25b-4ce8-8183-8b08fa5adba4-3
00:04:48.291 --> 00:04:51.943
of doing is doing batch
invoicing which would we have

b7a2ddf2-d25b-4ce8-8183-8b08fa5adba4-4
00:04:51.943 --> 00:04:55.932
two types of invoices that kind
of come through for normal

b7a2ddf2-d25b-4ce8-8183-8b08fa5adba4-5
00:04:55.932 --> 00:04:59.989
order, say outside of fabric
orders and they entail some of

b7a2ddf2-d25b-4ce8-8183-8b08fa5adba4-6
00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:04.181
those have money on the order
that has to be applied and some

b7a2ddf2-d25b-4ce8-8183-8b08fa5adba4-7
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:06.209
have terms with like a factor.

6435660f-9175-44d6-8a82-3937d8ece65b-0
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.893
Bank or whatever that doesn't
have money on it and those can

6435660f-9175-44d6-8a82-3937d8ece65b-1
00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:13.744
just simply be invoiced out and
go to the right. We have EDI and

6435660f-9175-44d6-8a82-3937d8ece65b-2
00:05:13.744 --> 00:05:17.357
automation that takes those to
the right places overnight if

6435660f-9175-44d6-8a82-3937d8ece65b-3
00:05:17.357 --> 00:05:20.971
that makes sense. So I think we
could batch invoice the ones

6435660f-9175-44d6-8a82-3937d8ece65b-4
00:05:20.971 --> 00:05:24.762
that do not have money on them.
I think Ben has so much told us

6435660f-9175-44d6-8a82-3937d8ece65b-5
00:05:24.762 --> 00:05:28.138
that we could do that in the
past and so we were kind of

6435660f-9175-44d6-8a82-3937d8ece65b-6
00:05:28.138 --> 00:05:31.989
waiting for six through 8 to see
if that was even capability. So

6435660f-9175-44d6-8a82-3937d8ece65b-7
00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:35.484
that's the additional that I
would add in that we could do

6435660f-9175-44d6-8a82-3937d8ece65b-8
00:05:35.484 --> 00:05:36.610
that would help us.

f3801838-2bb6-4abb-a315-5e6cf67cee8a-0
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.101
About, but the any orders that
come through that have money

f3801838-2bb6-4abb-a315-5e6cf67cee8a-1
00:05:40.101 --> 00:05:43.523
that need to be applied like
deposits on them, I don't know

f3801838-2bb6-4abb-a315-5e6cf67cee8a-2
00:05:43.523 --> 00:05:47.173
if we can automate those. Those
a there's some issues right now

f3801838-2bb6-4abb-a315-5e6cf67cee8a-3
00:05:47.173 --> 00:05:50.652
with the the money. So at this
moment I would say let's hold

f3801838-2bb6-4abb-a315-5e6cf67cee8a-4
00:05:50.652 --> 00:05:53.960
off on those. But also maybe
it's something that we could

f3801838-2bb6-4abb-a315-5e6cf67cee8a-5
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.211
look at going forward. I just
don't know what that would

f3801838-2bb6-4abb-a315-5e6cf67cee8a-6
00:05:57.211 --> 00:06:00.804
entail. That's where we would
need IT's input for sure because

f3801838-2bb6-4abb-a315-5e6cf67cee8a-7
00:06:00.804 --> 00:06:04.340
I don't even know how I can't
wrap my brain around that. So I

f3801838-2bb6-4abb-a315-5e6cf67cee8a-8
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.420
just want to go ahead and put
that out there because.

1df085ad-8295-4708-a172-c86e9cf23d4c-0
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.685
If we're able to show you how we
invoice out, you'll we'll have

1df085ad-8295-4708-a172-c86e9cf23d4c-1
00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:15.426
to show you the two types or or
even the fabric samples. You

1df085ad-8295-4708-a172-c86e9cf23d4c-2
00:06:15.426 --> 00:06:19.045
know what does that look like
because they are two totally

1df085ad-8295-4708-a172-c86e9cf23d4c-3
00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:22.725
different processes and so if
you'll see that the ones that

1df085ad-8295-4708-a172-c86e9cf23d4c-4
00:06:22.725 --> 00:06:26.344
don't have money or deposit on
them that could be batched,

1df085ad-8295-4708-a172-c86e9cf23d4c-5
00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.717
invoiced, then we would
definitely like to add that in

1df085ad-8295-4708-a172-c86e9cf23d4c-6
00:06:29.717 --> 00:06:33.520
somewhere, whether it's on this
particular scope or if it's a

1df085ad-8295-4708-a172-c86e9cf23d4c-7
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.587
totally different ticket
project. Either way, any

1df085ad-8295-4708-a172-c86e9cf23d4c-8
00:06:36.587 --> 00:06:37.629
thoughts on that?

2e9e8634-52ea-4865-8312-288a6dd5836f-0
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.714
Does that make sense? I've
already, I've already been in

2e9e8634-52ea-4865-8312-288a6dd5836f-1
00:06:41.714 --> 00:06:45.780
discussion with Ben. Uh, on a
technical side. Yes we can.

6bf614cc-2aad-47ec-9992-ecf3b0f698b7-0
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.465
Basically we can invoice
everything but not move over

6bf614cc-2aad-47ec-9992-ecf3b0f698b7-1
00:06:53.465 --> 00:06:59.670
payment or a deposit if there is
there. So that's something um.

c062e419-eda2-467b-b1a0-f365e2898c47-0
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.244
Now the issue is how do we
allocate the the deposit to the

c062e419-eda2-467b-b1a0-f365e2898c47-1
00:07:05.244 --> 00:07:09.957
invoice if there is one. So that
definitely puts into the

c062e419-eda2-467b-b1a0-f365e2898c47-2
00:07:09.957 --> 00:07:15.319
condition of how this automation
can or what it could potentially

c062e419-eda2-467b-b1a0-f365e2898c47-3
00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:15.970
invoice.

e96ede6d-79a9-48cb-8985-fce8fdefeef3-0
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.063
It would have we, I would have
to do some research on my side

e96ede6d-79a9-48cb-8985-fce8fdefeef3-1
00:07:23.063 --> 00:07:27.120
if there's a way that we could
move that deposit money to an

e96ede6d-79a9-48cb-8985-fce8fdefeef3-2
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.444
invoice, but I cannot guarantee
you anything right now because I

e96ede6d-79a9-48cb-8985-fce8fdefeef3-3
00:07:31.444 --> 00:07:35.634
wouldn't know. The only thing I
would just throw in there then

e96ede6d-79a9-48cb-8985-fce8fdefeef3-4
00:07:35.634 --> 00:07:39.957
is if you're looking to automate
everything and then say there's

e96ede6d-79a9-48cb-8985-fce8fdefeef3-5
00:07:39.957 --> 00:07:44.015
a time frame where we would have
to manually move that money

e96ede6d-79a9-48cb-8985-fce8fdefeef3-6
00:07:44.015 --> 00:07:48.005
over, that's going to be really
involved on our side. It is

e96ede6d-79a9-48cb-8985-fce8fdefeef3-7
00:07:48.005 --> 00:07:49.070
actually easier.

5417f530-163a-4bc4-96b5-b8bf9a28d27c-0
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.520
Deposit on that invoice rather
than having to go through

5417f530-163a-4bc4-96b5-b8bf9a28d27c-1
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.160
another area and have to move it
off because that then we're

5417f530-163a-4bc4-96b5-b8bf9a28d27c-2
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.501
looking at like 3 or 4 steps to
do the one step that we

5417f530-163a-4bc4-96b5-b8bf9a28d27c-3
00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:03.141
currently do in the invoicing
process. If and we can kind of

5417f530-163a-4bc4-96b5-b8bf9a28d27c-4
00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:07.019
show you what that means because
it's it's kind of weird. So. So

5417f530-163a-4bc4-96b5-b8bf9a28d27c-5
00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:10.718
let me make sure I understand
what you just said. It's easier

5417f530-163a-4bc4-96b5-b8bf9a28d27c-6
00:08:10.718 --> 00:08:14.000
for you to move that deposit
money over to an invoice.

8a711d81-29e2-495c-a758-a115a542dbac-0
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.788
Through the the current process,
it is why we're in dispatch now

8a711d81-29e2-495c-a758-a115a542dbac-1
00:08:18.788 --> 00:08:22.231
while we're in dispatch notes
because it's it will prompt us

8a711d81-29e2-495c-a758-a115a542dbac-2
00:08:22.231 --> 00:08:25.448
to or we click a button
basically and then it prompts us

8a711d81-29e2-495c-a758-a115a542dbac-3
00:08:25.448 --> 00:08:29.116
to move that money over. Whereas
the other way we have to go in.

8a711d81-29e2-495c-a758-a115a542dbac-4
00:08:29.116 --> 00:08:32.559
I'm thinking and Ellen, correct
me if I'm wrong, it's almost

8a711d81-29e2-495c-a758-a115a542dbac-5
00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:36.058
like we would have to go into
deposit liability account, we'd

8a711d81-29e2-495c-a758-a115a542dbac-6
00:08:36.058 --> 00:08:39.670
have to write off that amount,
we'd have to post it then to the

8a711d81-29e2-495c-a758-a115a542dbac-7
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.339
customer account and all that's
real manual and you have to make

8a711d81-29e2-495c-a758-a115a542dbac-8
00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:43.960
sure, yeah.

58f5b55b-d978-4f3d-828b-352d1775b00a-0
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.115
That you when you get into that
manual, obviously we could post

58f5b55b-d978-4f3d-828b-352d1775b00a-1
00:08:49.115 --> 00:08:53.271
the wrong things that that sort
of thing. I don't know. So what

58f5b55b-d978-4f3d-828b-352d1775b00a-2
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:57.102
I understand is basically
long-term, yes, we would like to

58f5b55b-d978-4f3d-828b-352d1775b00a-3
00:08:57.102 --> 00:09:00.804
have all invoice and automate
it, but at this moment not

58f5b55b-d978-4f3d-828b-352d1775b00a-4
00:09:00.804 --> 00:09:04.765
anything, not any invoice with
money on it until we get that

58f5b55b-d978-4f3d-828b-352d1775b00a-5
00:09:04.765 --> 00:09:08.985
worked out because it's like she
said, it is easier to apply the

58f5b55b-d978-4f3d-828b-352d1775b00a-6
00:09:08.985 --> 00:09:13.271
money from dispatch notes in the
moment of invoicing versus going

58f5b55b-d978-4f3d-828b-352d1775b00a-7
00:09:13.271 --> 00:09:14.830
back. Totally agree one.

f8ea5631-c369-4f0d-9c01-953daaabe59f-0
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.259
The other thing to keep in mind,
I'm sorry, just I didn't mean to

f8ea5631-c369-4f0d-9c01-953daaabe59f-1
00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:23.336
throw you off, just to give you
more information of what I've

f8ea5631-c369-4f0d-9c01-953daaabe59f-2
00:09:23.336 --> 00:09:27.215
been in talks with Ben like
that. That's the thing I would

f8ea5631-c369-4f0d-9c01-953daaabe59f-3
00:09:27.215 --> 00:09:31.029
have to figure out. I could
probably automate how to move

f8ea5631-c369-4f0d-9c01-953daaabe59f-4
00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:35.040
that money over so that Syspro
doesn't throw any issues with

f8ea5631-c369-4f0d-9c01-953daaabe59f-5
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.248
it. It's just I don't know how
to do that right now, so I can't

f8ea5631-c369-4f0d-9c01-953daaabe59f-6
00:09:39.248 --> 00:09:43.521
promise you anything. Not not a
big deal. Definitely invoicing a

f8ea5631-c369-4f0d-9c01-953daaabe59f-7
00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:45.100
dispatch note we can do.

2afac21f-16ea-473e-93ce-65467c5de9a6-0
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.909
So the question is 1 invoice
everything without a deposit,

2afac21f-16ea-473e-93ce-65467c5de9a6-1
00:09:50.909 --> 00:09:56.038
invoice only fabric sample
orders that that's kind of goes

2afac21f-16ea-473e-93ce-65467c5de9a6-2
00:09:56.038 --> 00:10:01.428
into the question of scope what
to do with. Yeah, I would say

2afac21f-16ea-473e-93ce-65467c5de9a6-3
00:10:01.428 --> 00:10:07.166
for sure the fabric samples that
will continue with that and then

2afac21f-16ea-473e-93ce-65467c5de9a6-4
00:10:07.166 --> 00:10:09.340
if our choice is only to.

4102a1b6-2dad-444f-a949-f59b6fe94f96-0
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.900
Invoice everything else.

73cf03f1-a03c-4efc-ab63-351fa0edebba-0
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.839
Like you're saying or none, like
all or none, then we would say

73cf03f1-a03c-4efc-ab63-351fa0edebba-1
00:10:18.839 --> 00:10:23.168
none on the other. For now. If
it's where you could segregate

73cf03f1-a03c-4efc-ab63-351fa0edebba-2
00:10:23.168 --> 00:10:27.498
the hey, we've got these that
have money on them and the ones

73cf03f1-a03c-4efc-ab63-351fa0edebba-3
00:10:27.498 --> 00:10:31.688
that don't. And we could batch
invoice because right now we

73cf03f1-a03c-4efc-ab63-351fa0edebba-4
00:10:31.688 --> 00:10:35.668
actually invoice out SAT's
through a tool in syspro that

73cf03f1-a03c-4efc-ab63-351fa0edebba-5
00:10:35.668 --> 00:10:40.207
was built. And I was kind of in
my brain, I guess, thinking that

73cf03f1-a03c-4efc-ab63-351fa0edebba-6
00:10:40.207 --> 00:10:43.420
we would mimic that tool maybe
to be able to.

b828569c-f201-4f09-8d4f-7a7240ab8438-0
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.010
Um.

763a20a2-7cd1-4261-9311-3968bb4177eb-0
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.722
I don't know, probably not. But
I was thinking maybe that

763a20a2-7cd1-4261-9311-3968bb4177eb-1
00:10:49.722 --> 00:10:53.288
something in that would allow
you to then mimic and be able to

763a20a2-7cd1-4261-9311-3968bb4177eb-2
00:10:53.288 --> 00:10:56.798
take the ones that don't have
money on them and run that kind

763a20a2-7cd1-4261-9311-3968bb4177eb-3
00:10:56.798 --> 00:11:00.194
of automation and it look for
whatever in the coding to say

763a20a2-7cd1-4261-9311-3968bb4177eb-4
00:11:00.194 --> 00:11:03.307
hey we could go ahead and
invoice these out and it's a

763a20a2-7cd1-4261-9311-3968bb4177eb-5
00:11:03.307 --> 00:11:06.986
click of a button type deal. But
then again I could be incorrect

763a20a2-7cd1-4261-9311-3968bb4177eb-6
00:11:06.986 --> 00:11:10.496
because ET start with a 100 dash
whereas these others all are

763a20a2-7cd1-4261-9311-3968bb4177eb-7
00:11:10.496 --> 00:11:13.100
mixed bag of 200-220 according
to the branch.

9619c395-5808-49cf-a1e1-d2bf1b520ff2-0
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.716
So I just don't know what it
looks for when it invoices out

9619c395-5808-49cf-a1e1-d2bf1b520ff2-1
00:11:17.716 --> 00:11:21.597
that. So just so that you know
will not be considered in the

9619c395-5808-49cf-a1e1-d2bf1b520ff2-2
00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:25.478
invoicing automation. Yeah, they
already have kind of a deal

9619c395-5808-49cf-a1e1-d2bf1b520ff2-3
00:11:25.478 --> 00:11:28.976
where they're easy enough. I
don't think that we'll be

9619c395-5808-49cf-a1e1-d2bf1b520ff2-4
00:11:28.976 --> 00:11:30.440
needing anything there.

689ae385-6ed8-4d36-9356-17b68845a65b-0
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.656
So the last time we met um and
when we first started talking

689ae385-6ed8-4d36-9356-17b68845a65b-1
00:11:34.656 --> 00:11:38.745
about this, it was we wanted the
marketing orders to be able to

689ae385-6ed8-4d36-9356-17b68845a65b-2
00:11:38.745 --> 00:11:42.514
be invoiced, but those aren't
put into dispatch notes. Has

689ae385-6ed8-4d36-9356-17b68845a65b-3
00:11:42.514 --> 00:11:46.219
that changed since our last,
since the last meeting I was

689ae385-6ed8-4d36-9356-17b68845a65b-4
00:11:46.219 --> 00:11:49.541
involved in, not that I
understand. So there's they

689ae385-6ed8-4d36-9356-17b68845a65b-5
00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:51.330
still not in dispatch notes.

dcd81090-b8e7-45eb-aa3e-f236dbfb826c-0
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:56.066
OK. So that was part kind of
part of it, right, Stephanie?

dcd81090-b8e7-45eb-aa3e-f236dbfb826c-1
00:11:56.066 --> 00:12:00.325
Yeah, trying to get that part so
that it would show up and then

dcd81090-b8e7-45eb-aa3e-f236dbfb826c-2
00:12:00.325 --> 00:12:04.585
allow the kind of flow through.
Yeah, OK, just just making sure

dcd81090-b8e7-45eb-aa3e-f236dbfb826c-3
00:12:04.585 --> 00:12:05.649
I'm up to speed.

4f8e5c80-8a94-4fc2-9e9b-0ccbe95e1243-0
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.753
And I also will throw out there
that there are some of those

4f8e5c80-8a94-4fc2-9e9b-0ccbe95e1243-1
00:12:10.753 --> 00:12:13.750
marketing invoices that have
money on them.

c47c7f0f-d3a3-485e-8759-0755d2361a54-0
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.790
Not many, but some.

43287ab7-5241-4931-afaa-e834f988f477-0
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.360
That I have to do take payments
now.

0e4831ff-5fcf-4858-aad8-3dda35d1c194-0
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:20.580
OK.

baf27b89-4cdc-4f1f-82ef-f38e69f6af9e-0
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.163
Interesting. Didn't know. Some
people pay for them and some

baf27b89-4cdc-4f1f-82ef-f38e69f6af9e-1
00:12:26.163 --> 00:12:26.910
people don't.

fb41fa0f-f45f-4b02-a99b-020745cd5dd3-0
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.051
Have to meet a certain criteria
through sales to whether they're

fb41fa0f-f45f-4b02-a99b-020745cd5dd3-1
00:12:33.051 --> 00:12:36.610
charged for them or not that
you're correct. OK.

b8892d63-6d16-462f-b614-e5cd1e4669d2-0
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.710
Suggesting other thing on. Does
that kind of give you a little

b8892d63-6d16-462f-b614-e5cd1e4669d2-1
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:47.083
information? Let me ask what
what denotes a fabric sample

b8892d63-6d16-462f-b614-e5cd1e4669d2-2
00:12:47.083 --> 00:12:51.532
order or marketing order? What
what does that look like in

b8892d63-6d16-462f-b614-e5cd1e4669d2-3
00:12:51.532 --> 00:12:52.060
syspro?

202410d3-03c6-42ef-8d3c-60faa63d80aa-0
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:57.841
The the order terms, the AR
terms, uh, right. Well, the

202410d3-03c6-42ef-8d3c-60faa63d80aa-1
00:12:57.841 --> 00:13:02.864
warehouse is marketing. The
warehouse. Yeah, usually they're

202410d3-03c6-42ef-8d3c-60faa63d80aa-2
00:13:02.864 --> 00:13:07.970
well, it just depends if the
majority of them would be an AR.

65d2cb8f-acc6-4ac6-bc18-581059ceb132-0
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:10.520
Charge.

b18ef107-982a-4c7c-9daf-dcb7fcb36320-0
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.378
Is that what you're asking? The
R term that would be on the

b18ef107-982a-4c7c-9daf-dcb7fcb36320-1
00:13:14.378 --> 00:13:14.620
order.

f4641619-350b-44d5-a260-632261257f89-0
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:19.399
Ohh, so if I were to go into
Syspro right now and try to look

f4641619-350b-44d5-a260-632261257f89-1
00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:22.968
for a marketing sample order,
what what would I be looking

f4641619-350b-44d5-a260-632261257f89-2
00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:23.210
for?

f3c20593-959b-4c4f-aa7f-8faf41a5deec-0
00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.950
They don't typically show up on
my reports because I can touch

f3c20593-959b-4c4f-aa7f-8faf41a5deec-1
00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:31.041
on. So I don't know. I can give
you an order number to pull up

f3c20593-959b-4c4f-aa7f-8faf41a5deec-2
00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:32.170
and you can look at it.

52f74e47-37ce-4f14-8ac2-4b7cb57fc482-0
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.203
Um, well, I think he's asking
how would you know show your

52f74e47-37ce-4f14-8ac2-4b7cb57fc482-1
00:13:37.203 --> 00:13:41.673
screen Trish and that might so
that all of us can see it and

52f74e47-37ce-4f14-8ac2-4b7cb57fc482-2
00:13:41.673 --> 00:13:42.040
then.

19d60e0a-3c1e-441e-a969-0340a63a6fe4-0
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.767
Because we need to figure out if
this is getting just and what he

19d60e0a-3c1e-441e-a969-0340a63a6fe4-1
00:13:47.767 --> 00:13:50.893
needs, he's not going to be
going through the same module

19d60e0a-3c1e-441e-a969-0340a63a6fe4-2
00:13:50.893 --> 00:13:54.397
that we would to be able to see
him. So I had just run my report

19d60e0a-3c1e-441e-a969-0340a63a6fe4-3
00:13:54.397 --> 00:13:57.631
to approve orders, OK? It's
gonna be a marketing warehouse.

19d60e0a-3c1e-441e-a969-0340a63a6fe4-4
00:13:57.631 --> 00:14:00.380
So all of these are marketing
except for this one.

7c64437e-e2ae-4af5-8391-dc11376a4a6f-0
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:06.140
Because of the terms, right?
Yeah, two term so.

8ad1c235-eaf5-4742-94ce-370c169b306e-0
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:13.209
What open orders review? Where,
where do you get that report?

8ad1c235-eaf5-4742-94ce-370c169b306e-1
00:14:13.209 --> 00:14:18.447
It's one of our SQL reports.
Yeah, I wanna say it's under

8ad1c235-eaf5-4742-94ce-370c169b306e-2
00:14:18.447 --> 00:14:22.060
operations. Is it? Let me look
and see.

1e248eb6-988a-4d6f-8e4e-30cd5001ce63-0
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.582
Get over to my sequel reports.
Well, it's in my favorites, so

1e248eb6-988a-4d6f-8e4e-30cd5001ce63-1
00:14:26.582 --> 00:14:29.560
let's see what's it under? It's
under operations.

cfc75ed1-fead-43d9-b597-9dd9a88e9587-0
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.380
Options, Open orders, review,
yeah.

1f1e6798-8deb-46a8-b49e-ffef0e714fdd-0
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.510
Um.

6887c7fb-a2fe-4701-83be-04a92b31aed3-0
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.570
And so I just pull it into this
format.

561c16ec-bbd3-425a-95c8-273030cddef2-0
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.581
And SV, yeah and these are the
ones that I have to go put a

561c16ec-bbd3-425a-95c8-273030cddef2-1
00:14:43.581 --> 00:14:47.825
credit approval date on and and
they're, they're all marketing

561c16ec-bbd3-425a-95c8-273030cddef2-2
00:14:47.825 --> 00:14:52.204
except for this one that has the
warehouse as the main warehouse

561c16ec-bbd3-425a-95c8-273030cddef2-3
00:14:52.204 --> 00:14:54.360
and like Carla said it's an RMA.

7cc86602-1d65-409b-b366-9fbc1a04bb7f-0
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.780
But it can be, it can be
invoice, you know, once it's

7cc86602-1d65-409b-b366-9fbc1a04bb7f-1
00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.630
ready automatically, because
there's no money to take.

91f64ffa-4608-4c73-ada2-eff1e66dbd31-0
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.510
But it still has to be a
fulfill. It still has to be

91f64ffa-4608-4c73-ada2-eff1e66dbd31-1
00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.411
fulfilled, right? Right. Yeah.
Like once it's ready to ship.

91f64ffa-4608-4c73-ada2-eff1e66dbd31-2
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:15.441
OK. So Justin, you need to know
what makes this. It looks like

91f64ffa-4608-4c73-ada2-eff1e66dbd31-3
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:17.679
it's the marketing warehouse
MKTO.

fb943ced-95c0-46d5-920d-986be7b5d898-0
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.274
Terms could be MM or MI mean, I
don't know that the term. They

fb943ced-95c0-46d5-920d-986be7b5d898-1
00:15:23.274 --> 00:15:27.146
could be several things and if
they owe money on it, it could

fb943ced-95c0-46d5-920d-986be7b5d898-2
00:15:27.146 --> 00:15:31.268
be even a term we use on regular
orders, but that's going to be a

fb943ced-95c0-46d5-920d-986be7b5d898-3
00:15:31.268 --> 00:15:34.765
handful like Ellen said. Is
there something else you're

fb943ced-95c0-46d5-920d-986be7b5d898-4
00:15:34.765 --> 00:15:38.762
looking forward to tag kind of
in your coding how to find these

fb943ced-95c0-46d5-920d-986be7b5d898-5
00:15:38.762 --> 00:15:38.949
or?

26a2b0e9-7856-4fc2-b7d3-ff3921b0daee-0
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:46.432
Right, so I I can go look into
that report to see how it works

26a2b0e9-7856-4fc2-b7d3-ff3921b0daee-1
00:15:46.432 --> 00:15:50.310
and if we are only invoicing
orders.

a1d270ad-b44d-4d48-b7a7-1821b65e8fff-0
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:51.960
Or.

037ea582-b9ff-48ce-8cdb-5bd132f21644-0
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:58.671
Let's pause. There's a lot of
facets to this. So you talked

037ea582-b9ff-48ce-8cdb-5bd132f21644-1
00:15:58.671 --> 00:16:04.417
about how marketing, uh, fabric
sample orders don't get into

037ea582-b9ff-48ce-8cdb-5bd132f21644-2
00:16:04.417 --> 00:16:05.830
dispatch notes.

82e847aa-5681-4107-b8e2-20dde63eb28f-0
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:11.120
Correct. And that's something
that we want to do.

f2014a39-1c08-495b-a6eb-0e411dd11443-0
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.090
Yeah, that's a a facet.

b0c156eb-84d1-4694-94f3-be1485a9fee9-0
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:20.005
Mm-hmm. Yeah, because right now
Gwen brings me all their pick

b0c156eb-84d1-4694-94f3-be1485a9fee9-1
00:16:20.005 --> 00:16:23.500
tickets and I invoice from that
pick ticket.

b83c6d25-3a5e-4d4f-b191-4d22277e22cd-0
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:29.723
That's what kicks Ellen off to
knows she can invoice it is the

b83c6d25-3a5e-4d4f-b191-4d22277e22cd-1
00:16:29.723 --> 00:16:32.700
actual physical. Here's a pic
ticket so.

1ce7907b-73ae-4687-b153-5885be213169-0
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.840
I don't. I don't know if this
gets into the realm of something

1ce7907b-73ae-4687-b153-5885be213169-1
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.131
y'all don't know the pick ticket
comes from datascope, correct?

1ce7907b-73ae-4687-b153-5885be213169-2
00:16:41.131 --> 00:16:41.800
Think so. So.

f06bed13-b8e7-4505-a732-f7e340c6777a-0
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.990
Interesting. Datascope does not.

2a1b4094-6baa-4b1d-9223-209ff15a2ce3-0
00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.808
Does that just go not speak to
syspro? Is that how a dispatch

2a1b4094-6baa-4b1d-9223-209ff15a2ce3-1
00:16:52.808 --> 00:16:58.287
note normally is created? If it
is been dispatched from data

2a1b4094-6baa-4b1d-9223-209ff15a2ce3-2
00:16:58.287 --> 00:17:03.676
scope, it immediately creates a
dispatching note in Syspro.

2a1b4094-6baa-4b1d-9223-209ff15a2ce3-3
00:17:03.676 --> 00:17:08.975
That's something I can look into
why a fabric sample order

2a1b4094-6baa-4b1d-9223-209ff15a2ce3-4
00:17:08.975 --> 00:17:14.094
doesn't come in as a dispatch
note, and that could kinda

2a1b4094-6baa-4b1d-9223-209ff15a2ce3-5
00:17:14.094 --> 00:17:16.430
answer a lot of questions.

c1a4b589-928a-47fa-b60c-a0315a0cbf15-0
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:19.303
They might not have that
capability like they do in the

c1a4b589-928a-47fa-b60c-a0315a0cbf15-1
00:17:19.303 --> 00:17:21.290
back when we're shipping regular
orders.

ffd6fb3d-e4c2-4ecb-8888-ce5ed12e23cf-0
00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.970
Well, the other thing I think
maybe and I hope I don't

ffd6fb3d-e4c2-4ecb-8888-ce5ed12e23cf-1
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.213
confuses, but Ellen, when you
receive those tickets from do

ffd6fb3d-e4c2-4ecb-8888-ce5ed12e23cf-2
00:17:30.213 --> 00:17:34.881
you have to take the information
that will stick your information

ffd6fb3d-e4c2-4ecb-8888-ce5ed12e23cf-3
00:17:34.881 --> 00:17:38.842
she's given you. Then you
manually enter the pro number

ffd6fb3d-e4c2-4ecb-8888-ce5ed12e23cf-4
00:17:38.842 --> 00:17:43.227
and the carrier. OK, so that too
is part of this wanting that

ffd6fb3d-e4c2-4ecb-8888-ce5ed12e23cf-5
00:17:43.227 --> 00:17:45.420
information to be added to the.

4e3b9135-fc86-451d-92b2-80c3596f29e7-0
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.502
The order automatically. And I
wonder if in that somehow that

4e3b9135-fc86-451d-92b2-80c3596f29e7-1
00:17:50.502 --> 00:17:54.617
there's something that toggles
or triggers that to come over

4e3b9135-fc86-451d-92b2-80c3596f29e7-2
00:17:54.617 --> 00:17:58.800
from datascope. Does that make
sense to us? And I don't know.

4e3b9135-fc86-451d-92b2-80c3596f29e7-3
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.049
I'm probably confusing you more
here, but I don't know off the

4e3b9135-fc86-451d-92b2-80c3596f29e7-4
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:07.030
hand exactly what you're talking
about, but I've seen some

4e3b9135-fc86-451d-92b2-80c3596f29e7-5
00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:11.347
information and definitely in in
whatever this turns out to be,

4e3b9135-fc86-451d-92b2-80c3596f29e7-6
00:18:11.347 --> 00:18:15.529
we can make sure that happens
for these fabric sample orders.

455a29d9-8cd4-4bcf-98d9-301299e6cdc5-0
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:20.243
But I feel like somewhere last
year it's Stephanie may know she

455a29d9-8cd4-4bcf-98d9-301299e6cdc5-1
00:18:20.243 --> 00:18:24.057
might have been involved in it,
that they were able to get some

455a29d9-8cd4-4bcf-98d9-301299e6cdc5-2
00:18:24.057 --> 00:18:27.692
of this carrier information to
automatically pull to regular

455a29d9-8cd4-4bcf-98d9-301299e6cdc5-3
00:18:27.692 --> 00:18:28.110
orders.

2ea3ce2d-9cf2-4e9f-9720-00352bb1b286-0
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.708
But again, that might have been
through mode. You're starting to

2ea3ce2d-9cf2-4e9f-9720-00352bb1b286-1
00:18:32.708 --> 00:18:36.399
get into. You know, who do we
use for these carriers? Yeah. So

2ea3ce2d-9cf2-4e9f-9720-00352bb1b286-2
00:18:36.399 --> 00:18:39.973
when you say it's multifaceted,
yes, it is. It's crazy. Miss

2ea3ce2d-9cf2-4e9f-9720-00352bb1b286-3
00:18:39.973 --> 00:18:43.664
Ellen, I thought they started
trying to enter that information

2ea3ce2d-9cf2-4e9f-9720-00352bb1b286-4
00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.949
on the marketing orders, did
they not?

25d5146c-8b46-4d57-8ad4-3c6b36b70f7d-0
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:51.080
Ohh God Ellen, still doing it
for nail. It's it's really.

7d87bb93-b4aa-45c2-ad77-536a2fadb14f-0
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.360
It's OK.

ca6c3071-000f-463d-8ec7-35dbd2886cf7-0
00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:54.750
Yeah.

16bc4a0e-2e17-40a6-966f-d80b65de0715-0
00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.773
OK, what else? Before we get too
far off, what uh, what

16bc4a0e-2e17-40a6-966f-d80b65de0715-1
00:19:00.773 --> 00:19:05.234
information comes off this pick
ticket that needs to be on this

16bc4a0e-2e17-40a6-966f-d80b65de0715-2
00:19:05.234 --> 00:19:06.210
dispatch note?

081a37bf-96bf-447a-a84c-7101e652ac9f-0
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:12.684
Well, it would be the carrier
like FedEx and most most of them

081a37bf-96bf-447a-a84c-7101e652ac9f-1
00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:17.034
are FedEx. Some of them go
through the mail and some of

081a37bf-96bf-447a-a84c-7101e652ac9f-2
00:19:17.034 --> 00:19:22.006
them UPS, but mostly FedEx and
then that FedEx tracking number.

081a37bf-96bf-447a-a84c-7101e652ac9f-3
00:19:22.006 --> 00:19:25.579
Those are the two things that I
that I enter.

1c6b4d3a-b010-4819-92f4-d90947bfcbec-0
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.807
You know, so that if we look
back at the order, we'll have

1c6b4d3a-b010-4819-92f4-d90947bfcbec-1
00:19:29.807 --> 00:19:30.700
that information.

d89a2da4-e95a-4ae4-b289-1b0de6a7885d-0
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:35.490
The this information goes on to
the invoice within syspro.

5b118662-065d-44b2-90c2-db740efb9d75-0
00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:37.590
It does.

bbb3a33e-160c-43b5-85a4-49ab916aa1c3-0
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:42.448
Yes, she actually goes into the
sales order and manually types

bbb3a33e-160c-43b5-85a4-49ab916aa1c3-1
00:19:42.448 --> 00:19:46.148
it and then when from the sales
order is converted to the

bbb3a33e-160c-43b5-85a4-49ab916aa1c3-2
00:19:46.148 --> 00:19:50.039
invoice then it's on there.
Yeah, those are, yeah, those are

bbb3a33e-160c-43b5-85a4-49ab916aa1c3-3
00:19:50.039 --> 00:19:53.931
invoice directly from the sales
order versus you know, since

bbb3a33e-160c-43b5-85a4-49ab916aa1c3-4
00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:58.077
they're not in dispatch note. So
we entered that information and

bbb3a33e-160c-43b5-85a4-49ab916aa1c3-5
00:19:58.077 --> 00:19:59.799
then invoice it from there.

ff5ad741-60ec-43c0-bbd0-91b5b8582a83-0
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.956
Because it's not showing up in
your queue to be invoiced yet

ff5ad741-60ec-43c0-bbd0-91b5b8582a83-1
00:20:05.956 --> 00:20:09.695
again, the physical paper is
what's kicking that invoicing

ff5ad741-60ec-43c0-bbd0-91b5b8582a83-2
00:20:09.695 --> 00:20:11.660
process off for them currently.

4cf39124-e1b6-4f50-ab47-9775768f4791-0
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.430
OK.

163c1ea3-7967-498d-ba6e-92069dbd5fa4-0
00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.775
So it seems like that
information needs to be entered

163c1ea3-7967-498d-ba6e-92069dbd5fa4-1
00:20:32.775 --> 00:20:36.515
first and then if Gwen had
access to go in and toggle or do

163c1ea3-7967-498d-ba6e-92069dbd5fa4-2
00:20:36.515 --> 00:20:39.320
whatever it is they do to have
the order go.

73269f79-59e7-4f0a-b827-e8a3ae87239d-0
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.580
From being an order to being put
into dispatch notes.

a5b47a12-d612-4ccb-9a3f-6d6e4742d958-0
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:49.826
Seems like the logical Helen ask
answer me this when you receive

a5b47a12-d612-4ccb-9a3f-6d6e4742d958-1
00:20:49.826 --> 00:20:54.383
those pick tickets from Lynn,
what status is that order in at

a5b47a12-d612-4ccb-9a3f-6d6e4742d958-2
00:20:54.383 --> 00:20:59.086
that point? Is it a four? OK, so
that might be important to you

a5b47a12-d612-4ccb-9a3f-6d6e4742d958-3
00:20:59.086 --> 00:21:03.569
to know that that status is
going to be a status for to know

a5b47a12-d612-4ccb-9a3f-6d6e4742d958-4
00:21:03.569 --> 00:21:05.260
it's ready to go maybe.

ea790ed1-8902-4441-8192-8ba4ef40a0b6-0
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.857
Anything else Gwen has to put on
the order other than put in a

ea790ed1-8902-4441-8192-8ba4ef40a0b6-1
00:21:10.857 --> 00:21:14.434
status for spring the pick
tickets and then we have to

ea790ed1-8902-4441-8192-8ba4ef40a0b6-2
00:21:14.434 --> 00:21:18.661
manually enter that carrier and
the tracking information so that

ea790ed1-8902-4441-8192-8ba4ef40a0b6-3
00:21:18.661 --> 00:21:22.433
it then can be it will be
included on the invoice because

ea790ed1-8902-4441-8192-8ba4ef40a0b6-4
00:21:22.433 --> 00:21:24.710
it comes from that sales order
so.

cdbc6ec7-210a-4439-98a5-a8df211bbeed-0
00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.603
Don't know if that helps or
hinders no stop me if I'm asking

cdbc6ec7-210a-4439-98a5-a8df211bbeed-1
00:21:31.603 --> 00:21:32.680
stupid questions.

9838c2c7-6250-4efb-b48b-69ded599a433-0
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:39.214
Yeah, the ohh, we are trying to
smooth this all out, trying to

9838c2c7-6250-4efb-b48b-69ded599a433-1
00:21:39.214 --> 00:21:44.298
figure out the requirements that
will make all your lives a lot

9838c2c7-6250-4efb-b48b-69ded599a433-2
00:21:44.298 --> 00:21:45.570
easier and yeah.

d9107388-4ce8-4e8a-ac59-c4b7f87e34d0-0
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:47.060
Definitely.

3bad3f5e-e95a-480b-85fe-a8fee41e9ae3-0
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:48.620
Um.

fa95b946-b98e-4d9a-8521-5b220483d34a-0
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:57.951
Anything else you can think of,
I know you don't know what you

fa95b946-b98e-4d9a-8521-5b220483d34a-1
00:21:57.951 --> 00:22:02.912
don't know, but that's what I'm
trying to think of some things

fa95b946-b98e-4d9a-8521-5b220483d34a-2
00:22:02.912 --> 00:22:07.243
as well, right. So on
specifically marketing orders so

fa95b946-b98e-4d9a-8521-5b220483d34a-3
00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:12.283
far I got your report that you
know how to denote whether order

fa95b946-b98e-4d9a-8521-5b220483d34a-4
00:22:12.283 --> 00:22:16.693
is marketing or not. I'll use
that to try to glean some

fa95b946-b98e-4d9a-8521-5b220483d34a-5
00:22:16.693 --> 00:22:21.340
information off to make sure
that's included into the this

fa95b946-b98e-4d9a-8521-5b220483d34a-6
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.600
automation that.

c0d7311c-6d21-469f-839c-38cb93863541-0
00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:28.034
I'm working on, um, something to
follow up is whether or not

c0d7311c-6d21-469f-839c-38cb93863541-1
00:22:28.034 --> 00:22:32.794
these marketing orders are
actually being, uh, getting a

c0d7311c-6d21-469f-839c-38cb93863541-2
00:22:32.794 --> 00:22:37.805
dispatch note created, and if
it's not, see what we need to

c0d7311c-6d21-469f-839c-38cb93863541-3
00:22:37.805 --> 00:22:42.900
do, if anything, to get that
dispatch note created, correct?

51142125-4cac-478a-91eb-88a66d3ac1b8-0
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.210
True, yes.

26d8a5de-403e-4128-9202-352425c76518-0
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:46.330
Then.

1250348a-437e-438b-83c9-62746fe2114b-0
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:52.947
Well, I can tell you they're not
in dispatch notes now. We're the

1250348a-437e-438b-83c9-62746fe2114b-1
00:22:52.947 --> 00:22:56.390
ones being created, and it's not
going to dispatch nodes.

d02b0040-9d54-4bb2-b254-e0db8f3363b5-0
00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:01.316
I don't know. There's definitely
something that has to toggle. In

d02b0040-9d54-4bb2-b254-e0db8f3363b5-1
00:23:01.316 --> 00:23:05.497
other words, from, I guess Gwen
sod or whoever. I assume there's

d02b0040-9d54-4bb2-b254-e0db8f3363b5-2
00:23:05.497 --> 00:23:09.550
no one between Gwen and Ellen at
that point when it's ready to

d02b0040-9d54-4bb2-b254-e0db8f3363b5-3
00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:13.410
go. So yeah, so that's what
Justin's going to try to figure

d02b0040-9d54-4bb2-b254-e0db8f3363b5-4
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:17.335
out, is what kicks off that
part. Or or we need to figure it

d02b0040-9d54-4bb2-b254-e0db8f3363b5-5
00:23:17.335 --> 00:23:21.066
out for him or whatever. Just
let us know how we can help

d02b0040-9d54-4bb2-b254-e0db8f3363b5-6
00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:24.733
Justin. I don't know. I can. I
can go back there and ask

d02b0040-9d54-4bb2-b254-e0db8f3363b5-7
00:23:24.733 --> 00:23:26.020
questions if I need.

5f34bd64-8cc0-4009-ac10-33fcd1735144-0
00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:32.362
Let let me do some digging on my
side of the technical side to

5f34bd64-8cc0-4009-ac10-33fcd1735144-1
00:23:32.362 --> 00:23:37.498
see if there's some setting that
we need to flip to start getting

5f34bd64-8cc0-4009-ac10-33fcd1735144-2
00:23:37.498 --> 00:23:42.245
these dispatch notes created,
because I think that will make

5f34bd64-8cc0-4009-ac10-33fcd1735144-3
00:23:42.245 --> 00:23:46.836
all of our lives easier. If
everything has a dispatch note

5f34bd64-8cc0-4009-ac10-33fcd1735144-4
00:23:46.836 --> 00:23:51.660
and then all we have to do is
invoice the dispatch note, yes,

5f34bd64-8cc0-4009-ac10-33fcd1735144-5
00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:56.251
perfect. And then we fall back
to invoicing dispatch notes

5f34bd64-8cc0-4009-ac10-33fcd1735144-6
00:23:56.251 --> 00:23:57.030
based off.

389d8a2c-c515-44ac-a343-e53e06335856-0
00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:01.732
If it has a deposit or if it
doesn't have a deposit and then

389d8a2c-c515-44ac-a343-e53e06335856-1
00:24:01.732 --> 00:24:04.600
laying out if it does have a
deposit.

8e544551-c75d-493f-a385-e1555b52b268-0
00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.752
There is a process to carry that
information, that money over to

8e544551-c75d-493f-a385-e1555b52b268-1
00:24:09.752 --> 00:24:14.018
the invoice and we can go from
there, perfect. But even if it

8e544551-c75d-493f-a385-e1555b52b268-2
00:24:14.018 --> 00:24:18.352
even, you know, if we if we can
just get it in dispatch notes,

8e544551-c75d-493f-a385-e1555b52b268-3
00:24:18.352 --> 00:24:22.481
it would be wonderful whether
there was a way to group them

8e544551-c75d-493f-a385-e1555b52b268-4
00:24:22.481 --> 00:24:26.471
together or whatever. Just
having them in dispatch notes,

8e544551-c75d-493f-a385-e1555b52b268-5
00:24:26.471 --> 00:24:30.668
at least they would be getting
invoiced every day, which I'm

8e544551-c75d-493f-a385-e1555b52b268-6
00:24:30.668 --> 00:24:34.865
not getting them done every day.
Right there. They're in our

8e544551-c75d-493f-a385-e1555b52b268-7
00:24:34.865 --> 00:24:35.210
face.

5693846a-fe32-49a5-b578-7a9004b0c12f-0
00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.682
They their front center, so yeah
having to dig for them. So just

5693846a-fe32-49a5-b578-7a9004b0c12f-1
00:24:39.682 --> 00:24:43.408
we two things comes to mind as
far as getting you more

5693846a-fe32-49a5-b578-7a9004b0c12f-2
00:24:43.408 --> 00:24:47.540
information about the process of
the invoicing. I do believe

5693846a-fe32-49a5-b578-7a9004b0c12f-3
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:51.942
somewhere we have notes that we
can definitely get you, but I do

5693846a-fe32-49a5-b578-7a9004b0c12f-4
00:24:51.942 --> 00:24:56.142
think there's value and you're
seeing the process as well. So

5693846a-fe32-49a5-b578-7a9004b0c12f-5
00:24:56.142 --> 00:25:00.342
we could have if Trish could
walk us through that since she's

5693846a-fe32-49a5-b578-7a9004b0c12f-6
00:25:00.342 --> 00:25:01.900
got her screen kind of.

d53a63ea-46a9-497d-83fc-c93b8498e405-0
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.904
Open. And don't let me, if
you've got other questions jump

d53a63ea-46a9-497d-83fc-c93b8498e405-1
00:25:05.904 --> 00:25:09.167
in. I was just going to say, I
do believe we've got some kind

d53a63ea-46a9-497d-83fc-c93b8498e405-2
00:25:09.167 --> 00:25:12.272
of written instructions as well
as as far as the invoicing

d53a63ea-46a9-497d-83fc-c93b8498e405-3
00:25:12.272 --> 00:25:15.640
process that we could get that
to you that correlates with what

d53a63ea-46a9-497d-83fc-c93b8498e405-4
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.640
she'll be showing you if that
helps. Yeah, that would be

d53a63ea-46a9-497d-83fc-c93b8498e405-5
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.640
great. OK, perfect.

a414b7c3-1c01-4f8f-a2b2-f6ce18623e5b-0
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.010
Give me one second.

bbe066a4-a5f3-4c3b-bf8d-e71589f6b174-0
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.460
And not to put pressure on
nutrition, but do you have those

bbe066a4-a5f3-4c3b-bf8d-e71589f6b174-1
00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.449
notes? Because I think you're
the one that's provided all of

bbe066a4-a5f3-4c3b-bf8d-e71589f6b174-2
00:25:29.449 --> 00:25:32.487
us with them. When Miss Allen
first showed me how to invoice,

bbe066a4-a5f3-4c3b-bf8d-e71589f6b174-3
00:25:32.487 --> 00:25:32.830
I took.

d1593d60-43bd-4f3b-8ff6-c7ea6652172e-0
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.310
What do you call it? Um?

958d6298-27a4-459a-a306-ab53ab7233c7-0
00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.659
Not really to have them. Not
real notes, but I took notes to

958d6298-27a4-459a-a306-ab53ab7233c7-1
00:25:41.659 --> 00:25:45.160
where I understood it. And then
when we had to train other

958d6298-27a4-459a-a306-ab53ab7233c7-2
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.780
people, then we started doing
better notes. So yeah, we have

958d6298-27a4-459a-a306-ab53ab7233c7-3
00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.459
the notes somewhere based off of
the initial scribble scratch

958d6298-27a4-459a-a306-ab53ab7233c7-4
00:25:52.459 --> 00:25:56.078
that I did. Yeah, we'll review
those and we're going just to

958d6298-27a4-459a-a306-ab53ab7233c7-5
00:25:56.078 --> 00:25:59.817
make sure nothing's changed and
and just clarify, I don't mind

958d6298-27a4-459a-a306-ab53ab7233c7-6
00:25:59.817 --> 00:26:03.377
looking at that to. OK. So I
need to make sure you guys are

958d6298-27a4-459a-a306-ab53ab7233c7-7
00:26:03.377 --> 00:26:06.937
seeing my correct screen. Hold
on, let me make sure, let me

958d6298-27a4-459a-a306-ab53ab7233c7-8
00:26:06.937 --> 00:26:07.649
make a note.

42469d39-2ea7-4a68-bcc9-749ec20633ac-0
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:08.510
2.

158f9bbb-59d2-4255-8be0-a283897d0ed2-0
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:11.420
So that I can include them in
the document.

3d5b55ad-6c7e-4f67-873c-5b83274ff1d9-0
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.730
That'll be helpful.

6ce2374f-2bed-4d8e-aeaa-7009adfcd6a8-0
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.595
Let me make a note that it will
make uh knowing how to move

6ce2374f-2bed-4d8e-aeaa-7009adfcd6a8-1
00:26:20.595 --> 00:26:25.321
payments over if that's
documented. Um, from the sales

6ce2374f-2bed-4d8e-aeaa-7009adfcd6a8-2
00:26:25.321 --> 00:26:27.040
order to an invoice.

118c334f-abd6-4f5a-a70d-614f3720573b-0
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:32.369
There's a we can do that.
There's a lot of but if this but

118c334f-abd6-4f5a-a70d-614f3720573b-1
00:26:32.369 --> 00:26:36.185
if that so that's OK we can
define it. We can define it

118c334f-abd6-4f5a-a70d-614f3720573b-2
00:26:36.185 --> 00:26:40.341
though. So Trish and I can work
on that together just making

118c334f-abd6-4f5a-a70d-614f3720573b-3
00:26:40.341 --> 00:26:44.702
sure that our notes are pretty
clear on that. All the different

118c334f-abd6-4f5a-a70d-614f3720573b-4
00:26:44.702 --> 00:26:49.198
scenarios we could think of when
it comes to the payments now and

118c334f-abd6-4f5a-a70d-614f3720573b-5
00:26:49.198 --> 00:26:53.286
just to just to clarify you're
saying like when we're going

118c334f-abd6-4f5a-a70d-614f3720573b-6
00:26:53.286 --> 00:26:57.306
through dispatch or what would
it take outside of dispatch

118c334f-abd6-4f5a-a70d-614f3720573b-7
00:26:57.306 --> 00:26:59.010
notes to move money from?

803a2d81-cc49-4c94-bc83-ffc21c2ba08c-0
00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:04.938
A customers account too. So
right now I know that Syspro has

803a2d81-cc49-4c94-bc83-ffc21c2ba08c-1
00:27:04.938 --> 00:27:09.681
a way to invoice the dispatch
note with a deposit on, but

803a2d81-cc49-4c94-bc83-ffc21c2ba08c-2
00:27:09.681 --> 00:27:14.588
programmatically it doesn't
doesn't work the way we want it

803a2d81-cc49-4c94-bc83-ffc21c2ba08c-3
00:27:14.588 --> 00:27:19.741
to. I don't know the specifics
of well even during our testing

803a2d81-cc49-4c94-bc83-ffc21c2ba08c-4
00:27:19.741 --> 00:27:24.402
is just for a deposit, the
deposit module was always the

803a2d81-cc49-4c94-bc83-ffc21c2ba08c-5
00:27:24.402 --> 00:27:26.119
issue for accounting.

bf739b79-5cf3-495c-94e6-4f3517b86420-0
00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.902
A lot of that says for weight
stuff because it kept

bf739b79-5cf3-495c-94e6-4f3517b86420-1
00:27:30.902 --> 00:27:34.641
calculating just craziness,
weirdness. So I I believe you

bf739b79-5cf3-495c-94e6-4f3517b86420-2
00:27:34.641 --> 00:27:38.380
when you say that. OK, so from
what I understand is like.

48481ecb-7ac9-464a-a6cd-56e29f78db2b-0
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:43.970
The creating an invoice from a
dispatch note with no deposit on

48481ecb-7ac9-464a-a6cd-56e29f78db2b-1
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:48.641
it. That works and that can
definitely be automated. Um, the

48481ecb-7ac9-464a-a6cd-56e29f78db2b-2
00:27:48.641 --> 00:27:49.560
question is.

2afea638-0429-4f0a-8135-c7ea1ff20331-0
00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:55.177
The process of how to move that
money off the sales order to

2afea638-0429-4f0a-8135-c7ea1ff20331-1
00:27:55.177 --> 00:27:59.775
that customer account and then
from that customer account to

2afea638-0429-4f0a-8135-c7ea1ff20331-2
00:27:59.775 --> 00:28:00.680
the invoice.

57dcf78d-0bab-47f0-8440-6ffa5af8ec12-0
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:06.950
It's multiple steps
programmatically to do and.

f7ea4114-4cec-4550-b97d-e062e0f7d730-0
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:12.654
The question is, is can we do
that without any issues

f7ea4114-4cec-4550-b97d-e062e0f7d730-1
00:28:12.654 --> 00:28:16.560
successfully and accurately all
the time? So.

6f79aeaf-7b2a-4fbb-b72a-ab9e7588bcb2-0
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:19.090
OK.

20cc5314-2702-4c36-8d87-3e2bab15da4b-0
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:25.059
Some fun times for can you see
my dispatch note screen? I can

20cc5314-2702-4c36-8d87-3e2bab15da4b-1
00:28:25.059 --> 00:28:28.670
see it, yes, yes. OK, so let me
start the process.

4b4fbb89-4f8f-41bc-a2e6-fed9ab42524f-0
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.017
Miss Allen, do we have stuff in
there? I hadn't been in there

4b4fbb89-4f8f-41bc-a2e6-fed9ab42524f-1
00:28:33.017 --> 00:28:33.280
today.

39085418-ccf9-4b02-8e9d-7bbb09624393-0
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:35.620
Yeah, we are.

16f12e04-a2b5-46c9-b6ea-730b3d86a49d-0
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.570
Fiat.

4826370e-b2d7-4f4c-ada8-262f6168fa9f-0
00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:42.034
I don't know if there's anymore
in there or not. I hope so.

4826370e-b2d7-4f4c-ada8-262f6168fa9f-1
00:28:42.034 --> 00:28:44.550
Yeah, there's too. I might take
payments.

033f1095-6bc4-4835-8186-4cabc5ded20a-0
00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:50.513
I need to ask the other ones to
not invoice um for a little bit

033f1095-6bc4-4835-8186-4cabc5ded20a-1
00:28:50.513 --> 00:28:54.414
because I have to, I have to go
in and do some invoicing and

033f1095-6bc4-4835-8186-4cabc5ded20a-2
00:28:54.414 --> 00:28:58.443
record it for Ben, um, for those
issues we were having. Before

033f1095-6bc4-4835-8186-4cabc5ded20a-3
00:28:58.443 --> 00:29:02.409
you do that, will you go up the
options and show all and make

033f1095-6bc4-4835-8186-4cabc5ded20a-4
00:29:02.409 --> 00:29:06.374
sure that's everything and then
we'll see if there's any that

033f1095-6bc4-4835-8186-4cabc5ded20a-5
00:29:06.374 --> 00:29:10.467
have no money as well. OK, so,
so the ones in red, I don't know

033f1095-6bc4-4835-8186-4cabc5ded20a-6
00:29:10.467 --> 00:29:14.177
how familiar you are with
dispatch notes, Justin, but the

033f1095-6bc4-4835-8186-4cabc5ded20a-7
00:29:14.177 --> 00:29:15.840
ones in red or West Coast?

c10b1b08-92fd-4930-9a1a-108ab889cc90-0
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:20.017
The orders that we can invoice
because they're not ready, um,

c10b1b08-92fd-4930-9a1a-108ab889cc90-1
00:29:20.017 --> 00:29:24.218
so out of all of these is still
only these two and they both say

c10b1b08-92fd-4930-9a1a-108ab889cc90-2
00:29:24.218 --> 00:29:25.640
they have money on it.

e413aff5-db9a-4ca5-9590-acc4ef21cf93-0
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.200
Umm.

4cccf3a1-58a4-4368-8d70-70da0dc2964a-0
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.938
So you open up the dispatch.
We'll go back. Go back because

4cccf3a1-58a4-4368-8d70-70da0dc2964a-1
00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:36.456
Justin doesn't know this screen.
Tell him what tells you it has

4cccf3a1-58a4-4368-8d70-70da0dc2964a-2
00:29:36.456 --> 00:29:38.380
money or doesn't have money on
it.

39e1e357-ab45-4b71-b96a-12bf8acf3820-0
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:43.284
Yeah I I know more or less the
back end. I have no clue what.

39e1e357-ab45-4b71-b96a-12bf8acf3820-1
00:29:43.284 --> 00:29:47.391
Ohh OK you look he doesn't say
the user friendly he gets the

39e1e357-ab45-4b71-b96a-12bf8acf3820-2
00:29:47.391 --> 00:29:51.565
the complicated side. I get yeah
I get the complicated side I

39e1e357-ab45-4b71-b96a-12bf8acf3820-3
00:29:51.565 --> 00:29:55.268
don't I don't see this so I
can't. I'm not gonna be as

39e1e357-ab45-4b71-b96a-12bf8acf3820-4
00:29:55.268 --> 00:29:59.577
quick. So my apologies. OK. So
first we can't do the West Coast

39e1e357-ab45-4b71-b96a-12bf8acf3820-5
00:29:59.577 --> 00:30:03.550
DC orders which are all red.
They're not ready to invoice.

39e1e357-ab45-4b71-b96a-12bf8acf3820-6
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:07.859
They're they're in the process
of shipping to the West Coast DC

39e1e357-ab45-4b71-b96a-12bf8acf3820-7
00:30:07.859 --> 00:30:09.610
but and they're satisfied.

de00baf1-b9e6-4e41-ac34-af36fa394937-0
00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.765
Once it turns to a status 7 then
we can invoice it and then if

de00baf1-b9e6-4e41-ac34-af36fa394937-1
00:30:13.765 --> 00:30:17.786
you look to the left it tells
you the why means there's money

de00baf1-b9e6-4e41-ac34-af36fa394937-2
00:30:17.786 --> 00:30:18.630
on the order.

6b6188c8-926c-4bad-a2bd-a37840124a47-0
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:24.053
So Carrier has to be something
other than WCDC and thankfully

6b6188c8-926c-4bad-a2bd-a37840124a47-1
00:30:24.053 --> 00:30:28.493
they've got these color-coded
for us so that our little eyes

6b6188c8-926c-4bad-a2bd-a37840124a47-2
00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:32.934
don't have to skim around. So
red like she said yes is no go

6b6188c8-926c-4bad-a2bd-a37840124a47-3
00:30:32.934 --> 00:30:37.374
yet. But when it turns white in
the carrier column, which is

6b6188c8-926c-4bad-a2bd-a37840124a47-4
00:30:37.374 --> 00:30:41.669
that second column of this
spreadsheet looking cute, those

6b6188c8-926c-4bad-a2bd-a37840124a47-5
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:45.746
are good to invoice out
typically. And then she says on

6b6188c8-926c-4bad-a2bd-a37840124a47-6
00:30:45.746 --> 00:30:49.749
the counter sales deposit, which
is that first column.

dd1cf6f3-1506-4b81-91da-dfea9cbbe762-0
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.932
We also have a color coding
going on in that area where it's

dd1cf6f3-1506-4b81-91da-dfea9cbbe762-1
00:30:53.932 --> 00:30:58.025
a blue if there's money with a Y
and if it's blank, I guess,

dd1cf6f3-1506-4b81-91da-dfea9cbbe762-2
00:30:58.025 --> 00:31:01.917
right? And that's why then
there's no money on that order

dd1cf6f3-1506-4b81-91da-dfea9cbbe762-3
00:31:01.917 --> 00:31:05.808
to be right. And I think
sometimes it even has an end for

dd1cf6f3-1506-4b81-91da-dfea9cbbe762-4
00:31:05.808 --> 00:31:06.010
no.

92ad6192-6e0b-4fa0-85df-7f3dfae4f8b1-0
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:11.173
And then for no payment, I can't
being that. Yeah, when we have

92ad6192-6e0b-4fa0-85df-7f3dfae4f8b1-1
00:31:11.173 --> 00:31:14.924
to slow down, we can't remember.
We're like, yeah, we're working

92ad6192-6e0b-4fa0-85df-7f3dfae4f8b1-2
00:31:14.924 --> 00:31:18.676
like little machines over here.
We're kind of automated too, but

92ad6192-6e0b-4fa0-85df-7f3dfae4f8b1-3
00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:21.965
it will be, it will be white,
like Carla said, and it'll

92ad6192-6e0b-4fa0-85df-7f3dfae4f8b1-4
00:31:21.965 --> 00:31:25.774
either have it in or or nothing,
but it's white and we'll be able

92ad6192-6e0b-4fa0-85df-7f3dfae4f8b1-5
00:31:25.774 --> 00:31:29.180
to invoice it with no money on
it. And it does have to be.

3088a907-c154-4626-a003-c84f1e3d6e42-0
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:34.800
Status. Yeah, for it to be ready
to invoice.

9f210c6c-5ccf-43a6-80e4-c70eba3632ff-0
00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:35.820
OK.

b3dcd89e-d729-4504-b704-8585c543c2ce-0
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:37.830
Um.

9d9505ac-df03-4f28-87b8-0800b33902e9-0
00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:44.143
Ellen correct clarify the status
7 means. What does that tell us

9d9505ac-df03-4f28-87b8-0800b33902e9-1
00:31:44.143 --> 00:31:46.450
when it changes from 5 to 7?

30bcc20e-b3ce-4fc7-ab29-748b10af574b-0
00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:50.592
Does that mean carrier
information is on that? Well,

30bcc20e-b3ce-4fc7-ab29-748b10af574b-1
00:31:50.592 --> 00:31:54.402
that means it's like she said,
it just means it's ready to

30bcc20e-b3ce-4fc7-ab29-748b10af574b-2
00:31:54.402 --> 00:31:58.341
invoice. There's there's nothing
else going to be done to it

30bcc20e-b3ce-4fc7-ab29-748b10af574b-3
00:31:58.341 --> 00:32:01.957
until we invoice. It means
they're still working on the

30bcc20e-b3ce-4fc7-ab29-748b10af574b-4
00:32:01.957 --> 00:32:05.573
details on that order. The
carrier has not been entered

30bcc20e-b3ce-4fc7-ab29-748b10af574b-5
00:32:05.573 --> 00:32:06.090
yet, OK?

b5e6eb4e-b9a2-4bf7-9d5a-1833b23012d7-0
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:12.368
Right. And I I'm not all
familiar with what they have to

b5e6eb4e-b9a2-4bf7-9d5a-1833b23012d7-1
00:32:12.368 --> 00:32:16.814
do in the background to change
it from 1-1 status to another.

b5e6eb4e-b9a2-4bf7-9d5a-1833b23012d7-2
00:32:16.814 --> 00:32:21.189
Um, I just know that when it's
seven, then it's ready and it

b5e6eb4e-b9a2-4bf7-9d5a-1833b23012d7-3
00:32:21.189 --> 00:32:23.700
may be like, y'all said,
entering.

c6e309c9-1b0f-49d7-955c-c0b803ed2619-0
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:28.611
Because I don't know what they
do to initially push it into

c6e309c9-1b0f-49d7-955c-c0b803ed2619-1
00:32:28.611 --> 00:32:32.329
dispatch news. I want to learn.
I want to learn that whole

c6e309c9-1b0f-49d7-955c-c0b803ed2619-2
00:32:32.329 --> 00:32:36.362
process just to understand it.
Like how many steps they have. I

c6e309c9-1b0f-49d7-955c-c0b803ed2619-3
00:32:36.362 --> 00:32:39.640
don't even know who they. Who's
they? I don't know.

6dcf2798-1ead-472d-8628-6675413ae588-0
00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:47.037
I really don't. But you know,
I'm not. I'm not to go off on a

6dcf2798-1ead-472d-8628-6675413ae588-1
00:32:47.037 --> 00:32:52.056
too far of a tangent, but I know
it's it's a interaction between

6dcf2798-1ead-472d-8628-6675413ae588-2
00:32:52.056 --> 00:32:57.075
data scope and syspro. Once it's
been fully dispatched, it sends

6dcf2798-1ead-472d-8628-6675413ae588-3
00:32:57.075 --> 00:33:01.476
it over to Syspro and Syspro
picks it up and creates the

6dcf2798-1ead-472d-8628-6675413ae588-4
00:33:01.476 --> 00:33:06.187
dispatch note and puts it in
that status 7. And that's to do

6dcf2798-1ead-472d-8628-6675413ae588-5
00:33:06.187 --> 00:33:10.820
with when they put it on the
truck and they scan it in and.

154edec4-718b-4a12-96fc-2404fc85fb39-0
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:16.364
All that perfect. Yeah. OK good.
So to give a little background,

154edec4-718b-4a12-96fc-2404fc85fb39-1
00:33:16.364 --> 00:33:21.468
I've already worked on a project
to move freight and surcharges

154edec4-718b-4a12-96fc-2404fc85fb39-2
00:33:21.468 --> 00:33:26.254
over to dispatch notes. I'm, I'm
I'm sure you have a little

154edec4-718b-4a12-96fc-2404fc85fb39-3
00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:31.119
understanding of that. Talk
about where we last year we were

154edec4-718b-4a12-96fc-2404fc85fb39-4
00:33:31.119 --> 00:33:35.905
splitting off the calculation
and it was calculating in the

154edec4-718b-4a12-96fc-2404fc85fb39-5
00:33:35.905 --> 00:33:40.371
system for us. OK. Yes I did
that work well. Thank you,

154edec4-718b-4a12-96fc-2404fc85fb39-6
00:33:40.371 --> 00:33:40.930
Justin.

3e89112b-1baf-4f21-917d-dbc74e0d93ea-0
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.972
Thank you. I love trying out the
stuff for that, but definitely I

3e89112b-1baf-4f21-917d-dbc74e0d93ea-1
00:33:46.972 --> 00:33:52.293
understand a little bit of the
dispatch. Perfect. Yeah. All

3e89112b-1baf-4f21-917d-dbc74e0d93ea-2
00:33:52.293 --> 00:33:53.180
right. So.

0230e64c-61fd-4b3f-aed4-7059f9305e08-0
00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.974
Let me just make sure again that
all are showing and it is um,

0230e64c-61fd-4b3f-aed4-7059f9305e08-1
00:33:58.974 --> 00:33:59.180
so.

91340485-e239-421e-b7a8-64a96cc210c4-0
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:05.177
Since these are sevens, I'm just
gonna open it up to to invoice

91340485-e239-421e-b7a8-64a96cc210c4-1
00:34:05.177 --> 00:34:09.737
it, and I click enter and it
tells me you know again status 7

91340485-e239-421e-b7a8-64a96cc210c4-2
00:34:09.737 --> 00:34:14.297
ready to invoice and it's paid.
So we know again that there's

91340485-e239-421e-b7a8-64a96cc210c4-3
00:34:14.297 --> 00:34:19.004
money on it and so all we have
to do is click in dispatch, make

91340485-e239-421e-b7a8-64a96cc210c4-4
00:34:19.004 --> 00:34:19.740
sure that.

ad8292f0-fdf5-44d2-8147-2be8cbf26217-0
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:25.090
That field name for the paid
column.

90d96015-4300-497b-ab54-6fa411b8363e-0
00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:30.170
Invoice terms invoice terms,
invoice terms OK.

0a0795ee-6487-4a45-9edd-25ad86713a2a-0
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:34.586
Yeah, the invoice terms will
typically tell you if there's

0a0795ee-6487-4a45-9edd-25ad86713a2a-1
00:34:34.586 --> 00:34:38.215
money was supposed to be
collected or not. It if it has,

0a0795ee-6487-4a45-9edd-25ad86713a2a-2
00:34:38.215 --> 00:34:42.098
if it's a B time that means
there is a deposit. I don't know

0a0795ee-6487-4a45-9edd-25ad86713a2a-3
00:34:42.098 --> 00:34:46.173
those are typically show up for
us to invoice that they do from

0a0795ee-6487-4a45-9edd-25ad86713a2a-4
00:34:46.173 --> 00:34:50.120
time to time if they ship them
anyways. But it'd be important

0a0795ee-6487-4a45-9edd-25ad86713a2a-5
00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:54.067
for you to have all those terms
of what is what so be and PSP

0a0795ee-6487-4a45-9edd-25ad86713a2a-6
00:34:54.067 --> 00:34:57.760
there's a ton of them. And
Justin I could work on getting

0a0795ee-6487-4a45-9edd-25ad86713a2a-7
00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.880
you maybe a list of kind of
terms you might see.

a5040e54-3443-40f1-beaf-8085eaf4a5e6-0
00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.173
There's money on the order as
well, if that's important,

a5040e54-3443-40f1-beaf-8085eaf4a5e6-1
00:35:04.173 --> 00:35:07.611
definitely. And then all the
terms where there's no money on

a5040e54-3443-40f1-beaf-8085eaf4a5e6-2
00:35:07.611 --> 00:35:11.162
the order, Carla, right? Well,
that's everything. That's about

a5040e54-3443-40f1-beaf-8085eaf4a5e6-3
00:35:11.162 --> 00:35:11.670
50 or so.

7587e422-4746-4998-aa30-46018625c38d-0
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:17.840
Yeah, um, OK. So I click in
dispatch, make sure that um the

7587e422-4746-4998-aa30-46018625c38d-1
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.604
document to print, make sure
that invoice is checked and that

7587e422-4746-4998-aa30-46018625c38d-2
00:35:22.604 --> 00:35:24.910
it's the optio syspro printer.

bfeb3d11-23ff-4d89-9d9e-d0a2d24b60ba-0
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:30.252
And as long as that's correct, I
know there's money on this

bfeb3d11-23ff-4d89-9d9e-d0a2d24b60ba-1
00:35:30.252 --> 00:35:32.000
order, so I click take payment.

e792c3fc-3c3b-42f1-9939-8163eb2495a9-0
00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.990
And entered the bank.

99437bca-a82d-4a38-94ac-7e6571141f06-0
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:43.701
And then it says there are
deposits. Do you wish to view

99437bca-a82d-4a38-94ac-7e6571141f06-1
00:35:43.701 --> 00:35:46.718
the deposit? Yes, I do. So it
here's, here's 2 deposits

99437bca-a82d-4a38-94ac-7e6571141f06-2
00:35:46.718 --> 00:35:49.520
because we take a deposit and
then the balance due.

bee25c8a-f0af-43f7-bfc9-867a9bd888ba-0
00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:50.810
So.

6f6ebb64-3d67-469b-8356-3270d362c16f-0
00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.245
If you move this and look down
here where it tells me the

6f6ebb64-3d67-469b-8356-3270d362c16f-1
00:35:55.245 --> 00:35:58.415
deposit on file and then the
invoice, I always make sure that

6f6ebb64-3d67-469b-8356-3270d362c16f-2
00:35:58.415 --> 00:36:01.279
that matches because if it
doesn't then I'll have to do

6f6ebb64-3d67-469b-8356-3270d362c16f-3
00:36:01.279 --> 00:36:02.660
something differently. But.

7921eae6-47d1-4ccc-9fdc-bb52951ab045-0
00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.450
All you have to do is highlight
your deposit. Click apply.

8dbc2bae-0bc8-4386-8a5e-c66b2b36f4ed-0
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:08.430
Click save.

54f1f03c-ca1e-4eea-a5c5-e03cf2cef6ad-0
00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:13.200
And then we know we need to
apply the other one as well.

23ef4d96-6d6a-4a1a-a971-cf90f5275993-0
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:19.187
Click apply, click save and it
asks you if payment is complete,

23ef4d96-6d6a-4a1a-a971-cf90f5275993-1
00:36:19.187 --> 00:36:20.260
and it is so.

ce7b80e3-48ca-421f-998f-d8c60afbd4f1-0
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:25.207
Yeah, that's OK. Keep going.
You've got another one. We'll

ce7b80e3-48ca-421f-998f-d8c60afbd4f1-1
00:36:25.207 --> 00:36:28.482
slow down a little bit because
there's fields that change that

ce7b80e3-48ca-421f-998f-d8c60afbd4f1-2
00:36:28.482 --> 00:36:31.810
he may need to see that date and
all that. That's OK. Go ahead.

ab9e47f7-f893-4f99-965a-4fa49da63e6f-0
00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:38.164
I could probably review this
recording and we we don't, we

ab9e47f7-f893-4f99-965a-4fa49da63e6f-1
00:36:38.164 --> 00:36:42.376
don't have to go super slow.
Yeah, so these, these fields do

ab9e47f7-f893-4f99-965a-4fa49da63e6f-2
00:36:42.376 --> 00:36:42.860
change.

7a83e3e2-65c6-4f07-8c09-2372741acc03-0
00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:48.972
So I did yes, it was complete.
And then we print it, reprint

7a83e3e2-65c6-4f07-8c09-2372741acc03-1
00:36:48.972 --> 00:36:50.190
this invoice no.

703c2675-e28d-4dcd-9a26-5b66d769e70a-0
00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.570
So then we go back.

fe0f5759-9348-46cf-9870-eae9f32d7ab4-0
00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:59.477
And it is now invoiced, it is
now invoice and it should show

fe0f5759-9348-46cf-9870-eae9f32d7ab4-1
00:36:59.477 --> 00:37:03.255
up. It's gonna show up on the
customer's account under their

fe0f5759-9348-46cf-9870-eae9f32d7ab4-2
00:37:03.255 --> 00:37:06.847
invoice tab on customer query
and because you applied the

fe0f5759-9348-46cf-9870-eae9f32d7ab4-3
00:37:06.847 --> 00:37:10.625
payment, it'll show it as a 0
balance invoice payment wasn't

fe0f5759-9348-46cf-9870-eae9f32d7ab4-4
00:37:10.625 --> 00:37:12.050
applied, it would show.

5f98200b-baa5-4b52-b0c0-88b2e210744e-0
00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:18.036
So until we physically move the
money, but typically when we see

5f98200b-baa5-4b52-b0c0-88b2e210744e-1
00:37:18.036 --> 00:37:22.143
that Justin if they're if we
always go out to the customer's

5f98200b-baa5-4b52-b0c0-88b2e210744e-2
00:37:22.143 --> 00:37:26.251
account right now. And I would
know there was an issue if it

5f98200b-baa5-4b52-b0c0-88b2e210744e-3
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:30.627
showed a DML being that she went
through all the proper steps of

5f98200b-baa5-4b52-b0c0-88b2e210744e-4
00:37:30.627 --> 00:37:34.330
applying the money. But
typically if that happens, the

5f98200b-baa5-4b52-b0c0-88b2e210744e-5
00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:38.370
order still in an open status
and the money is what we call

5f98200b-baa5-4b52-b0c0-88b2e210744e-6
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:42.612
stuck on the order and we would
then have to refund it off the

5f98200b-baa5-4b52-b0c0-88b2e210744e-7
00:37:42.612 --> 00:37:44.700
order then go into a different.

bad185e5-950b-477f-a173-811a85ffe5e4-0
00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:48.191
Module called payments and
adjustments on the AR side and

bad185e5-950b-477f-a173-811a85ffe5e4-1
00:37:48.191 --> 00:37:51.779
then apply the money there. In
the world that you're talking

bad185e5-950b-477f-a173-811a85ffe5e4-2
00:37:51.779 --> 00:37:55.544
about, I would think that once
it's invoiced out, it's going to

bad185e5-950b-477f-a173-811a85ffe5e4-3
00:37:55.544 --> 00:37:59.132
complete and if it completes
without money being transferred

bad185e5-950b-477f-a173-811a85ffe5e4-4
00:37:59.132 --> 00:38:02.720
off the order, that's a whole
nother set of steps to try to.

90b2ef87-8406-41cf-bdce-55bcc016283e-0
00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.858
Find the money from deposit
liability, move it over. It's

90b2ef87-8406-41cf-bdce-55bcc016283e-1
00:38:06.858 --> 00:38:10.377
multi step and that's why I said
it would be kind of weird for

90b2ef87-8406-41cf-bdce-55bcc016283e-2
00:38:10.377 --> 00:38:13.951
us, but it we could talk through
that what that would look like

90b2ef87-8406-41cf-bdce-55bcc016283e-3
00:38:13.951 --> 00:38:17.357
if we were to look at automating
everything, even stuff with

90b2ef87-8406-41cf-bdce-55bcc016283e-4
00:38:17.357 --> 00:38:20.150
money and having to physically
move that over so.

874ea705-8c03-4b31-9467-7a9f58d335d0-0
00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:25.238
OK probably lost you there but
TMI, I know I what so you're

874ea705-8c03-4b31-9467-7a9f58d335d0-1
00:38:25.238 --> 00:38:29.637
saying that sometimes during
this process the money doesn't

874ea705-8c03-4b31-9467-7a9f58d335d0-2
00:38:29.637 --> 00:38:34.255
get moved over to the invoice,
some glitches and says Bro, Ohh

874ea705-8c03-4b31-9467-7a9f58d335d0-3
00:38:34.255 --> 00:38:38.580
good there's no glitches. You
know that never happens. But

874ea705-8c03-4b31-9467-7a9f58d335d0-4
00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:43.052
yeah there's a glitch and for
whatever reason the money will

874ea705-8c03-4b31-9467-7a9f58d335d0-5
00:38:43.052 --> 00:38:47.671
stay on. The order is as if it
doesn't take it. And again this

874ea705-8c03-4b31-9467-7a9f58d335d0-6
00:38:47.671 --> 00:38:51.190
could be user error, this could
be us if we're.

a08bdbbf-10e3-43f3-920a-5f6682bbd75b-0
00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.730
Rocking and rolling. Maybe
something we didn't click and we

a08bdbbf-10e3-43f3-920a-5f6682bbd75b-1
00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:58.255
just didn't realize it. Or it
could be that yes, we should be

a08bdbbf-10e3-43f3-920a-5f6682bbd75b-2
00:38:58.255 --> 00:38:59.790
some opportunity and stuff.

8456fad9-8f9e-4659-a98c-48ded3eaf465-0
00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:06.486
210 Umm customers for contract,
they have a term that's CT which

8456fad9-8f9e-4659-a98c-48ded3eaf465-1
00:39:06.486 --> 00:39:11.156
their AR term CT means they pay
a 50% deposit and they get in

8456fad9-8f9e-4659-a98c-48ded3eaf465-2
00:39:11.156 --> 00:39:15.827
that 30 on the balance. So when
you're invoicing if you don't

8456fad9-8f9e-4659-a98c-48ded3eaf465-3
00:39:15.827 --> 00:39:20.648
know those customers so so once
once they pay a deposit and the

8456fad9-8f9e-4659-a98c-48ded3eaf465-4
00:39:20.648 --> 00:39:24.866
deposit is posted to their
order, they're terms on that

8456fad9-8f9e-4659-a98c-48ded3eaf465-5
00:39:24.866 --> 00:39:29.688
order changed to A3 for net 30.
So when it shows up in dispatch

8456fad9-8f9e-4659-a98c-48ded3eaf465-6
00:39:29.688 --> 00:39:31.270
node, it shows up as.

e7414c3a-5112-42fd-871f-21d0750bba34-0
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.870
Net 30 terms and anybody
logically would think that 30

e7414c3a-5112-42fd-871f-21d0750bba34-1
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:38.711
terms, there's no money, right,
because they get 30 days to pay.

e7414c3a-5112-42fd-871f-21d0750bba34-2
00:39:38.711 --> 00:39:42.434
So if you don't, if you don't
catch that and realize that that

e7414c3a-5112-42fd-871f-21d0750bba34-3
00:39:42.434 --> 00:39:46.098
customer has a deposit on the
order, then sometimes those get

e7414c3a-5112-42fd-871f-21d0750bba34-4
00:39:46.098 --> 00:39:49.585
invoice and the money's not
applied. But again, that would

e7414c3a-5112-42fd-871f-21d0750bba34-5
00:39:49.585 --> 00:39:53.308
mean that the order would stay
open. The money should still be

e7414c3a-5112-42fd-871f-21d0750bba34-6
00:39:53.308 --> 00:39:56.382
sitting there. It really
shouldn't have gone into a

e7414c3a-5112-42fd-871f-21d0750bba34-7
00:39:56.382 --> 00:40:00.046
complete status where we can't
maintain the order anymore. It

e7414c3a-5112-42fd-871f-21d0750bba34-8
00:40:00.046 --> 00:40:02.410
would still be open for us to
maintain.

77b17fc3-e47b-4100-816a-8559a9d157eb-0
00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:06.550
Yes, but there are times that
I'm saying that there's a glitch

77b17fc3-e47b-4100-816a-8559a9d157eb-1
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:10.321
she thing where the order is
complete but the money did not

77b17fc3-e47b-4100-816a-8559a9d157eb-2
00:40:10.321 --> 00:40:13.904
transfer over. And that's
typically when I have to go in

77b17fc3-e47b-4100-816a-8559a9d157eb-3
00:40:13.904 --> 00:40:17.865
and look and deposit liability,
see if the money's there, ride

77b17fc3-e47b-4100-816a-8559a9d157eb-4
00:40:17.865 --> 00:40:21.888
it through, ride it off that GL
in the background through yeah,

77b17fc3-e47b-4100-816a-8559a9d157eb-5
00:40:21.888 --> 00:40:26.036
process and Ellen could tell you
even more. There's just multiple

77b17fc3-e47b-4100-816a-8559a9d157eb-6
00:40:26.036 --> 00:40:29.682
steps that you have to do to
make sure that the that cash

77b17fc3-e47b-4100-816a-8559a9d157eb-7
00:40:29.682 --> 00:40:32.700
books correct the GL for a
deposit liabilities.

da242154-31d6-4da1-abdc-65493f100a2e-0
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:36.448
Correct. And the customer
accounts correct in all those

da242154-31d6-4da1-abdc-65493f100a2e-1
00:40:36.448 --> 00:40:40.257
steps. We had several of those
on the 19th that we talked

da242154-31d6-4da1-abdc-65493f100a2e-2
00:40:40.257 --> 00:40:44.461
about. And again Justin, I'm not
sure what kicks that off. It's

da242154-31d6-4da1-abdc-65493f100a2e-3
00:40:44.461 --> 00:40:48.336
when we find it, we try to
figure out you know, was it us,

da242154-31d6-4da1-abdc-65493f100a2e-4
00:40:48.336 --> 00:40:52.605
was it syspro. So again, I would
only think that if we automated

da242154-31d6-4da1-abdc-65493f100a2e-5
00:40:52.605 --> 00:40:56.283
things, we I would my hope,
fingers crossed would be we

da242154-31d6-4da1-abdc-65493f100a2e-6
00:40:56.283 --> 00:41:00.552
would see less of that for sure
because it's not us going in and

da242154-31d6-4da1-abdc-65493f100a2e-7
00:41:00.552 --> 00:41:03.180
clicking around, it's that same
script.

022b54a2-3d36-4f12-a97d-2324e24c2856-0
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:03.730
Running.

c75cc2fe-41fe-4cfd-938a-84d4cee126b8-0
00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:09.144
You know, for each of those
scenarios. So anyway, OK, well

c75cc2fe-41fe-4cfd-938a-84d4cee126b8-1
00:41:09.144 --> 00:41:13.588
you want to do this last one.
It's a ready to invoice with

c75cc2fe-41fe-4cfd-938a-84d4cee126b8-2
00:41:13.588 --> 00:41:14.040
money.

e2035d84-acc5-4984-a565-19726e481b22-0
00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.790
So it's ready to invoice. It's
been paid.

726a5335-4419-4a6b-ad2e-c856eb16e3d8-0
00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.550
So I'm gonna end the note.

018dd9d0-f7e3-4a95-8d1f-5f428f777181-0
00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.960
Invoice optio syspro printer.

8f4f2006-1825-49a6-9c44-d89abdccd261-0
00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:31.487
Take payment. It does have to be
up to you. I know you know this

8f4f2006-1825-49a6-9c44-d89abdccd261-1
00:41:31.487 --> 00:41:36.074
Justin so that it will write to
in files and invoice. e-mail the

8f4f2006-1825-49a6-9c44-d89abdccd261-2
00:41:36.074 --> 00:41:36.710
customer.

f25b3e37-424f-498a-b914-18e97ecf2839-0
00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.480
It has to be the Optio special
printer.

8ba80cc9-9ab9-4863-afb2-f38bf96cc242-0
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:42.050
Um.

233e5051-d500-4963-af9b-d14d7c05be51-0
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:48.545
That's another facet to this
project that we can discuss and

233e5051-d500-4963-af9b-d14d7c05be51-1
00:41:48.545 --> 00:41:54.283
we can figure out. OK, continue.
OK. There are deposits on file.

233e5051-d500-4963-af9b-d14d7c05be51-2
00:41:54.283 --> 00:41:59.757
Do you wish to view deposits?
Yes. And again, I always double

233e5051-d500-4963-af9b-d14d7c05be51-3
00:41:59.757 --> 00:42:04.966
check down here and you can
watch this change because it's

233e5051-d500-4963-af9b-d14d7c05be51-4
00:42:04.966 --> 00:42:10.174
undistributed right now, right.
So I'm gonna highlight the

233e5051-d500-4963-af9b-d14d7c05be51-5
00:42:10.174 --> 00:42:13.000
first. Let me pause you. OK. So.

770ba1dc-20e6-4fa9-9b17-8ceac57200f1-0
00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:18.638
Split ship when do y'all uh,
dispatch split ship items and

770ba1dc-20e6-4fa9-9b17-8ceac57200f1-1
00:42:18.638 --> 00:42:23.791
then in in this particular
process, if you're trying to

770ba1dc-20e6-4fa9-9b17-8ceac57200f1-2
00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:28.300
split a deposit, how do you go
about doing that?

4fb98495-83af-4e2c-b486-e689945a0ead-0
00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.301
Is one of those scenarios that
you're gonna see a little

4fb98495-83af-4e2c-b486-e689945a0ead-1
00:42:34.301 --> 00:42:39.067
different? This one's a clear
cut one, but you're correct. So

4fb98495-83af-4e2c-b486-e689945a0ead-2
00:42:39.067 --> 00:42:43.986
the terms would be SP if it's a
split chip and and yeah, the AR

4fb98495-83af-4e2c-b486-e689945a0ead-3
00:42:43.986 --> 00:42:48.982
terms would be SP and then so if
say if this were one down here,

4fb98495-83af-4e2c-b486-e689945a0ead-4
00:42:48.982 --> 00:42:53.979
I'd look at the deposit and say
the invoice total might only be,

4fb98495-83af-4e2c-b486-e689945a0ead-5
00:42:53.979 --> 00:42:58.514
you know, 1600 or whatever. So
then I would go up here and

4fb98495-83af-4e2c-b486-e689945a0ead-6
00:42:58.514 --> 00:42:59.359
apply 1600.

0efbc680-4f8d-44e3-8132-46d7f91474e0-0
00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:02.851
From the available deposit
deposits and the remaining

0efbc680-4f8d-44e3-8132-46d7f91474e0-1
00:43:02.851 --> 00:43:06.907
amount would stay there for the
back order to ship and you have

0efbc680-4f8d-44e3-8132-46d7f91474e0-2
00:43:06.907 --> 00:43:10.772
to physically like type in the
deposit. You have to override

0efbc680-4f8d-44e3-8132-46d7f91474e0-3
00:43:10.772 --> 00:43:14.384
the deposit amount right?
Because when you click this it

0efbc680-4f8d-44e3-8132-46d7f91474e0-4
00:43:14.384 --> 00:43:18.503
pulls over that full amount and
say go ahead. Yeah so if if this

0efbc680-4f8d-44e3-8132-46d7f91474e0-5
00:43:18.503 --> 00:43:22.368
invoice was only 1600, then I
would click this one and apply

0efbc680-4f8d-44e3-8132-46d7f91474e0-6
00:43:22.368 --> 00:43:26.361
it and that would save it and
that would apply the full amount

0efbc680-4f8d-44e3-8132-46d7f91474e0-7
00:43:26.361 --> 00:43:30.163
and then I'd have to come over
here and click the remaining

0efbc680-4f8d-44e3-8132-46d7f91474e0-8
00:43:30.163 --> 00:43:30.670
balance.

fbb9d92c-d943-471a-b4ee-c16f90d01f96-0
00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:35.230
Of the 1600, like when I click
apply, it puts it all in there

fbb9d92c-d943-471a-b4ee-c16f90d01f96-1
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:39.575
and I'd have to take that out
and put the remaining however

fbb9d92c-d943-471a-b4ee-c16f90d01f96-2
00:43:39.575 --> 00:43:44.283
much that is to equal the 1600s.
Yeah, you have to put $69 there

fbb9d92c-d943-471a-b4ee-c16f90d01f96-3
00:43:44.283 --> 00:43:48.773
for it. So I would I would put
69 and click save and it would

fbb9d92c-d943-471a-b4ee-c16f90d01f96-4
00:43:48.773 --> 00:43:53.336
apply it and then it would leave
the remaining deposit on that

fbb9d92c-d943-471a-b4ee-c16f90d01f96-5
00:43:53.336 --> 00:43:57.174
order so that when the back
order ships, we have the

fbb9d92c-d943-471a-b4ee-c16f90d01f96-6
00:43:57.174 --> 00:43:59.419
remaining deposit to apply. OK.

efb7506a-1dae-4bd3-a1fe-a86c8397d8e0-0
00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.380
Thank you. You're welcome.

64da6331-4a75-4c61-8b8e-f8d1bdd169ce-0
00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:09.330
OK, so I'm gonna make it back,
correct?

63f28fbb-d0e0-4a32-aa7d-9f8dcf7076f4-0
00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.430
And.

f893f72c-7998-4514-9075-d5b1ce6b3a8d-0
00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:18.411
I mean later I I need to invoice
later um to do a recording for

f893f72c-7998-4514-9075-d5b1ce6b3a8d-1
00:44:18.411 --> 00:44:18.770
Ben.

12c816ab-cb35-4baa-834a-b5e22028ed7d-0
00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:24.163
So that might help you when we
have some more in there that you

12c816ab-cb35-4baa-834a-b5e22028ed7d-1
00:44:24.163 --> 00:44:26.940
know we can actually invoice
different scenarios.

a99307aa-f675-45a9-a30d-43999b51d9bb-0
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:32.914
Yeah, Ben's gonna be checking.
Uh, you may know, just saying

a99307aa-f675-45a9-a30d-43999b51d9bb-1
00:44:32.914 --> 00:44:36.985
that we're running into some
Syspro 8 upgrade for about every

a99307aa-f675-45a9-a30d-43999b51d9bb-2
00:44:36.985 --> 00:44:40.464
7 to 8 that we invoice out
through dispatch notes is

a99307aa-f675-45a9-a30d-43999b51d9bb-3
00:44:40.464 --> 00:44:44.600
suddenly kicking us out of the
last one that we've done. And I

a99307aa-f675-45a9-a30d-43999b51d9bb-4
00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.736
think what does it do? And is it
kicking you completely out of

a99307aa-f675-45a9-a30d-43999b51d9bb-5
00:44:48.736 --> 00:44:52.676
syspro? OK. And then whatever
order we happen to be in that

a99307aa-f675-45a9-a30d-43999b51d9bb-6
00:44:52.676 --> 00:44:56.483
we're invoicing, sometimes
there's an error on that, like

a99307aa-f675-45a9-a30d-43999b51d9bb-7
00:44:56.483 --> 00:44:59.110
with the money we're having to
go back.

82d89c8e-c6f8-4071-93f6-80fa9e6b0b96-0
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:02.753
On some of those in fix, the
money didn't pull over correctly

82d89c8e-c6f8-4071-93f6-80fa9e6b0b96-1
00:45:02.753 --> 00:45:05.913
or whatever. So anyways,
Richard's working with Ben on

82d89c8e-c6f8-4071-93f6-80fa9e6b0b96-2
00:45:05.913 --> 00:45:09.304
that. So she'll have a recording
because she's going to go

82d89c8e-c6f8-4071-93f6-80fa9e6b0b96-3
00:45:09.304 --> 00:45:13.040
through that process and try to
go till it kicks her out so they

82d89c8e-c6f8-4071-93f6-80fa9e6b0b96-4
00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:16.430
can see what the error looks
like. But in that she'll have

82d89c8e-c6f8-4071-93f6-80fa9e6b0b96-5
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:19.821
quite a few for you to watch how
she's doing. Great. Yeah,

82d89c8e-c6f8-4071-93f6-80fa9e6b0b96-6
00:45:19.821 --> 00:45:22.982
because right now there's
actually no more that we can

82d89c8e-c6f8-4071-93f6-80fa9e6b0b96-7
00:45:22.982 --> 00:45:26.373
actually invoice. Umm, so I'm
sorry about that. I I wasn't

82d89c8e-c6f8-4071-93f6-80fa9e6b0b96-8
00:45:26.373 --> 00:45:27.350
thinking earlier.

b2bb542c-f6bf-4aa0-aa37-629859d96905-0
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:31.180
So um.

89c8ce68-e039-470c-9017-fbbe9faea86d-0
00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:38.826
Let's go back to when printing
the invoice. Uh, that specific

89c8ce68-e039-470c-9017-fbbe9faea86d-1
00:45:38.826 --> 00:45:41.400
printer option you say?

5f4c3f07-d771-4069-9d4a-951db6a15927-0
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.567
Optio syspro is what it's
called. It's a special printer

5f4c3f07-d771-4069-9d4a-951db6a15927-1
00:45:46.567 --> 00:45:48.790
that resides in Ellen's office.

6904d786-a13f-4c7d-9e08-f3f593fa2c9f-0
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:52.880
And it resides in the know
enough to be dangerous with

6904d786-a13f-4c7d-9e08-f3f593fa2c9f-1
00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.760
that. Oh, you can stop sharing
your screen OK.

5d7e3046-c33f-43a1-8365-b03e4ac6225e-0
00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:01.691
It's called Optio printer,
right? Yeah, optios is optio.

5d7e3046-c33f-43a1-8365-b03e4ac6225e-1
00:46:01.691 --> 00:46:04.210
Syspro is that what askio.
Syspro.

707461ba-b690-47ff-9e2b-1de2672a8e60-0
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:10.006
I think it's a space. Is there a
space or_that's in between those

707461ba-b690-47ff-9e2b-1de2672a8e60-1
00:46:10.006 --> 00:46:11.740
words? But anyways, yeah.

727e571f-94af-4d9f-9062-b957263009a1-0
00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:17.139
I can't remember and this
specific printer puts it in in

727e571f-94af-4d9f-9062-b957263009a1-1
00:46:17.139 --> 00:46:21.622
files and sends an invoice
e-mail to the customer. Yeah, it

727e571f-94af-4d9f-9062-b957263009a1-2
00:46:21.622 --> 00:46:25.732
has a script I guess that
records it in them files and

727e571f-94af-4d9f-9062-b957263009a1-3
00:46:25.732 --> 00:46:30.140
also shoots automatically
whatever e-mail addresses in our

727e571f-94af-4d9f-9062-b957263009a1-4
00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:34.698
AR e-mail. In syspro it shoots
the invoice copy, PDF copy to

727e571f-94af-4d9f-9062-b957263009a1-5
00:46:34.698 --> 00:46:35.670
the customer.

15c21c33-dc95-47ee-9445-9c87ee23fca7-0
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:37.860
Through that.

e9e3daa4-f3b1-4390-9ceb-ea69c70092ae-0
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:44.076
If we try to print it from say,
my brother printer, it won't do

e9e3daa4-f3b1-4390-9ceb-ea69c70092ae-1
00:46:44.076 --> 00:46:48.253
that. It will record it on the
customer's account as a invoice,

e9e3daa4-f3b1-4390-9ceb-ea69c70092ae-2
00:46:48.253 --> 00:46:51.190
but we would have to then go
through like a.

82bbf052-30dc-46f7-94e7-eaba166ae407-0
00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:56.825
Kind of a reprint process to get
that copy for the customer at

82bbf052-30dc-46f7-94e7-eaba166ae407-1
00:46:56.825 --> 00:47:00.360
that point and it would not
write it to him files.

7881f5f0-e328-4b20-8638-a484cff218fe-0
00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:05.810
So this kind of goes into a
future state that has been

7881f5f0-e328-4b20-8638-a484cff218fe-1
00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:10.188
recorded by Stephanie uh. We
want to reduce the amount of

7881f5f0-e328-4b20-8638-a484cff218fe-2
00:47:10.188 --> 00:47:14.490
emails that are sent to the
customer, correct? And that.

89b9d8e5-663e-4a79-b77c-8d8c06cb0d39-0
00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:20.387
In my mind would just be a
nightly process to e-mail all

89b9d8e5-663e-4a79-b77c-8d8c06cb0d39-1
00:47:20.387 --> 00:47:23.910
invoices and one e-mail to a
customer.

2b3de75b-a95e-4d3a-9dc5-1c697468f081-0
00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:28.854
Is that desired? Correct. I
believe that was correct. That

2b3de75b-a95e-4d3a-9dc5-1c697468f081-1
00:47:28.854 --> 00:47:33.026
was part of that scope that
you're saying if say customer

2b3de75b-a95e-4d3a-9dc5-1c697468f081-2
00:47:33.026 --> 00:47:35.760
1234 will just make it simple
has 15.

f1e0adc9-fc7d-476e-a21f-ec8a2298f20e-0
00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:40.130
Invoices from today, it would
batch those 15 together. Sheet

f1e0adc9-fc7d-476e-a21f-ec8a2298f20e-1
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:43.934
one e-mail. Here's your copies,
correct? So you're talking about

f1e0adc9-fc7d-476e-a21f-ec8a2298f20e-2
00:47:43.934 --> 00:47:45.690
individual customers that way.

529db98d-1beb-4194-a6f8-db39506927f1-0
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:51.058
Right. Uh, yes, yes, that would
be great. There was a concern

529db98d-1beb-4194-a6f8-db39506927f1-1
00:47:51.058 --> 00:47:54.639
there. I remember in our
conversations that was the

529db98d-1beb-4194-a6f8-db39506927f1-2
00:47:54.639 --> 00:47:58.770
initial thing that we talked
about. Yes, let's just send it

529db98d-1beb-4194-a6f8-db39506927f1-3
00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:02.832
once, but then they're shipping,
shipping notification and

529db98d-1beb-4194-a6f8-db39506927f1-4
00:48:02.832 --> 00:48:06.825
invoicing emails. So I think
what we settled on was maybe

529db98d-1beb-4194-a6f8-db39506927f1-5
00:48:06.825 --> 00:48:08.960
doing two to three times a day.

f12eef55-8e01-4c21-af56-65cb04af521a-0
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:14.444
Um, because the customer and you
guys have to correct me if I'm

f12eef55-8e01-4c21-af56-65cb04af521a-1
00:48:14.444 --> 00:48:18.956
wrong. Going from memory, the
customers sometimes didn't get

f12eef55-8e01-4c21-af56-65cb04af521a-2
00:48:18.956 --> 00:48:23.468
the invoice e-mail but got the
shipping e-mail or vice versa

f12eef55-8e01-4c21-af56-65cb04af521a-3
00:48:23.468 --> 00:48:25.170
and yeah, 1/2 positive.

017ece13-eed3-4003-a302-db21d6f6ce4e-0
00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.975
Happening there, I just know
when we receive a customer calls

017ece13-eed3-4003-a302-db21d6f6ce4e-1
00:48:29.975 --> 00:48:33.020
in and says hey, I haven't
received my e-mail that had my

017ece13-eed3-4003-a302-db21d6f6ce4e-2
00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:36.275
invoice copy, but they were the
ones that told us I I got the

017ece13-eed3-4003-a302-db21d6f6ce4e-3
00:48:36.275 --> 00:48:39.531
shipping notification, which was
an e-mail I didn't even know

017ece13-eed3-4003-a302-db21d6f6ce4e-4
00:48:39.531 --> 00:48:42.681
existed until all this came
about, but they'll receive that

017ece13-eed3-4003-a302-db21d6f6ce4e-5
00:48:42.681 --> 00:48:45.411
typically. It's like our
licensee, he says I got my

017ece13-eed3-4003-a302-db21d6f6ce4e-6
00:48:45.411 --> 00:48:48.614
shipping notification but I
didn't get my invoice. Something

017ece13-eed3-4003-a302-db21d6f6ce4e-7
00:48:48.614 --> 00:48:51.711
gets turned off. I think it's
when we're either testing or

017ece13-eed3-4003-a302-db21d6f6ce4e-8
00:48:51.711 --> 00:48:55.177
when we've done upgrade where we
have to turn off those automatic

017ece13-eed3-4003-a302-db21d6f6ce4e-9
00:48:55.177 --> 00:48:58.379
flow throughs that maybe they
just don't get turned back on.

4cf91778-8658-41bc-9c90-942ed475f721-0
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.957
Or maybe something trips in the
network. I'm not sure but it

4cf91778-8658-41bc-9c90-942ed475f721-1
00:49:01.957 --> 00:49:05.542
just seems like it's very random
when it happens. And typically

4cf91778-8658-41bc-9c90-942ed475f721-2
00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:09.071
I'll put a ticket in just say
hey we've got here's a couple of

4cf91778-8658-41bc-9c90-942ed475f721-3
00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:12.712
customers that's called in said
they didn't receive. Can you all

4cf91778-8658-41bc-9c90-942ed475f721-4
00:49:12.712 --> 00:49:15.961
check to make sure we're that
connection still there that

4cf91778-8658-41bc-9c90-942ed475f721-5
00:49:15.961 --> 00:49:19.603
we're sending out or what would
have happened maybe a timeout in

4cf91778-8658-41bc-9c90-942ed475f721-6
00:49:19.603 --> 00:49:23.020
the network or something that
caused it that this particular

4cf91778-8658-41bc-9c90-942ed475f721-7
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:26.493
customer didn't get that but
yeah and so there's that kind of

4cf91778-8658-41bc-9c90-942ed475f721-8
00:49:26.493 --> 00:49:28.229
going on too that sometimes if.

13148d0e-f52e-401e-a434-aea4de2b152f-0
00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:32.312
For whatever reason now it could
have been user error. Though

13148d0e-f52e-401e-a434-aea4de2b152f-1
00:49:32.312 --> 00:49:36.237
let's be honest, if some reason
we didn't have the optio printer

13148d0e-f52e-401e-a434-aea4de2b152f-2
00:49:36.237 --> 00:49:39.980
selected, that would also not
generate any e-mail to them. So

13148d0e-f52e-401e-a434-aea4de2b152f-3
00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:43.541
I typically will look there
first and make sure that I see

13148d0e-f52e-401e-a434-aea4de2b152f-4
00:49:43.541 --> 00:49:47.345
evidence of was that the case or
was it maybe something other?

13148d0e-f52e-401e-a434-aea4de2b152f-5
00:49:47.345 --> 00:49:51.027
And then I put the ticket in if
it looks like it's a network

13148d0e-f52e-401e-a434-aea4de2b152f-6
00:49:51.027 --> 00:49:51.390
thing.

586b5d3b-9665-404f-b4bf-b4bd3355885a-0
00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:57.013
But I'm feeling may have a
little bit more information as

586b5d3b-9665-404f-b4bf-b4bd3355885a-1
00:49:57.013 --> 00:50:00.749
to what specifically when we put
those tickets in May have caused

586b5d3b-9665-404f-b4bf-b4bd3355885a-2
00:50:00.749 --> 00:50:03.070
that on the the backside of
stuff, yeah.

90202308-3853-48f6-b533-2fad57b0ba84-0
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:05.220
I couldn't tell you. I'm sorry.

975e5c2d-4698-4e4d-b34b-983c8356d94c-0
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.640
Can I share my screen one more
time?

0fecee81-2241-4974-931b-ad24602ecf6c-0
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:14.685
We have, we have one that um ohh
no money. It's no money. Yeah.

0fecee81-2241-4974-931b-ad24602ecf6c-1
00:50:14.685 --> 00:50:19.376
So this one right here, that
shipping you UPS and you see

0fecee81-2241-4974-931b-ad24602ecf6c-2
00:50:19.376 --> 00:50:24.552
it's just, it's white. There's
no nothing over here um. So that

0fecee81-2241-4974-931b-ad24602ecf6c-3
00:50:24.552 --> 00:50:27.140
tells me there's no money on it.

aece43f1-f725-45b4-abba-1bdb4363927b-0
00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:33.618
So I open it up to dispatch,
ready to invoice, and I see it's

aece43f1-f725-45b4-abba-1bdb4363927b-1
00:50:33.618 --> 00:50:38.374
invoice terms three. So you
know, I know that that's a net

aece43f1-f725-45b4-abba-1bdb4363927b-2
00:50:38.374 --> 00:50:43.453
30 customer. That means I'll pay
later. They'll pay in 30 days

aece43f1-f725-45b4-abba-1bdb4363927b-3
00:50:43.453 --> 00:50:44.260
hopefully.

6a628fbd-5efa-4679-a6d9-c21ae4c6866c-0
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:49.251
So all we have to do on these
with no money is click in

6a628fbd-5efa-4679-a6d9-c21ae4c6866c-1
00:50:49.251 --> 00:50:49.930
dispatch.

b6f7239b-71ae-415d-9a9c-b8d0b0fa8aa5-0
00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:55.415
Make sure it's on invoice. Make
sure the document format is the

b6f7239b-71ae-415d-9a9c-b8d0b0fa8aa5-1
00:50:55.415 --> 00:50:59.791
optio syspro, and I don't see a
dash there, just optio syspro.

b6f7239b-71ae-415d-9a9c-b8d0b0fa8aa5-2
00:50:59.791 --> 00:51:04.028
OK yeah. And since there's no
money, the next step is simply

b6f7239b-71ae-415d-9a9c-b8d0b0fa8aa5-3
00:51:04.028 --> 00:51:05.070
to click print.

30d70d9b-1e62-4217-b4e5-c829a9ba4e44-0
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:09.780
And it pulls up and tells me
it's gonna print this combo

30d70d9b-1e62-4217-b4e5-c829a9ba4e44-1
00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:10.270
invoice.

e9e5e3d0-e155-46dd-8875-8da0bde6152c-0
00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:12.490
And I click OK.

213175a4-38a9-494f-adff-c6d4d2050818-0
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:17.417
And then this pops up and this
is basically asking me if I want

213175a4-38a9-494f-adff-c6d4d2050818-1
00:51:17.417 --> 00:51:21.684
to reprint the document and I do
not. So I click cancel and boom,

213175a4-38a9-494f-adff-c6d4d2050818-2
00:51:21.684 --> 00:51:22.590
it's invoiced.

5f0d780f-2042-40f0-86ef-4608fe4e26c9-0
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:28.238
Country ish because I don't know
if I've invoiced a lot since

5f0d780f-2042-40f0-86ef-4608fe4e26c9-1
00:51:28.238 --> 00:51:32.685
it's private, does it not still
bring up the other screen after

5f0d780f-2042-40f0-86ef-4608fe4e26c9-2
00:51:32.685 --> 00:51:34.770
the optio print where you say?

63677e71-4461-4cf2-a72c-5bcff7c0d789-0
00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:39.578
Payment only. Ohh I think it's a
recap. Does it not show the

63677e71-4461-4cf2-a72c-5bcff7c0d789-1
00:51:39.578 --> 00:51:42.972
little recap screen where it
shows you what is invoicing out?

63677e71-4461-4cf2-a72c-5bcff7c0d789-2
00:51:42.972 --> 00:51:44.450
It doesn't do that anymore.

cef38518-858b-4e8c-ba62-f8ee11010c7a-0
00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:50.778
I just wanna make sure and it
and it's weird about that. It

cef38518-858b-4e8c-ba62-f8ee11010c7a-1
00:51:50.778 --> 00:51:54.830
does look weird because it looks
different than it did before.

b75a40a9-6046-4b10-a3b1-a8946e226df6-0
00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:58.970
It's just that little box now
and you know at first was like

b75a40a9-6046-4b10-a3b1-a8946e226df6-1
00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:02.433
what is that? And then you look
and it's asking you basically do

b75a40a9-6046-4b10-a3b1-a8946e226df6-2
00:52:02.433 --> 00:52:05.790
you want to print it again, it's
just not in the the box shape

b75a40a9-6046-4b10-a3b1-a8946e226df6-3
00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:09.041
that we're used to seeing. So
Jason the only thing different

b75a40a9-6046-4b10-a3b1-a8946e226df6-4
00:52:09.041 --> 00:52:12.238
through the process was if it
has money we we determined it

b75a40a9-6046-4b10-a3b1-a8946e226df6-5
00:52:12.238 --> 00:52:14.210
has money, we do that take
payments.

56e16c0a-ae15-4482-b3a9-f5171b2a85c1-0
00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:18.717
And apply the payment. Otherwise
it's just a print, print print

56e16c0a-ae15-4482-b3a9-f5171b2a85c1-1
00:52:18.717 --> 00:52:22.474
kind of deal. It's like 3 clicks
and you're done when it has no

56e16c0a-ae15-4482-b3a9-f5171b2a85c1-2
00:52:22.474 --> 00:52:23.590
money to apply, so.

4e43f722-e0bf-4a1d-b3e9-a23a7274ba38-0
00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:25.930
Yeah, um.

25bdf9d8-1c43-4749-8a87-ef2d70c84a91-0
00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:32.932
The invoice y'all I know it's
been noted that not all invoices

25bdf9d8-1c43-4749-8a87-ef2d70c84a91-1
00:52:32.932 --> 00:52:37.607
are the same. Um y'all have
nothing like it. You just when

25bdf9d8-1c43-4749-8a87-ef2d70c84a91-2
00:52:37.607 --> 00:52:42.758
printing the invoice, it's just
automatically selected, correct?

25bdf9d8-1c43-4749-8a87-ef2d70c84a91-3
00:52:42.758 --> 00:52:47.988
It pulls from whatever is on the
sales orders. What's gonna write

25bdf9d8-1c43-4749-8a87-ef2d70c84a91-4
00:52:47.988 --> 00:52:50.920
to the invoice are we talking
about?

a445a73c-a30c-4a44-aaf7-5f152e023070-0
00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:57.087
When you say not the same time,
actually look at the invoice or.

a445a73c-a30c-4a44-aaf7-5f152e023070-1
00:52:57.087 --> 00:53:00.540
I'm sure that's more of a
marketing question.

eef50cf0-8459-4fc6-a47e-a1ecb37ca067-0
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:06.081
I think somewhere though I don't
know if we have a third party

eef50cf0-8459-4fc6-a47e-a1ecb37ca067-1
00:53:06.081 --> 00:53:09.876
that or or if it somehow puts
this on there. But marketing

eef50cf0-8459-4fc6-a47e-a1ecb37ca067-2
00:53:09.876 --> 00:53:13.864
provides the logo that goes on
each of these and according to

eef50cf0-8459-4fc6-a47e-a1ecb37ca067-3
00:53:13.864 --> 00:53:17.851
the branch specific there's a
different logo that goes on the

eef50cf0-8459-4fc6-a47e-a1ecb37ca067-4
00:53:17.851 --> 00:53:21.839
invoice. So that changes the
look of things also depending on

eef50cf0-8459-4fc6-a47e-a1ecb37ca067-5
00:53:21.839 --> 00:53:25.183
their terms, how they pay,
whether they are prepaid

eef50cf0-8459-4fc6-a47e-a1ecb37ca067-6
00:53:25.183 --> 00:53:29.106
customer with that money on the
order or their customer that

eef50cf0-8459-4fc6-a47e-a1ecb37ca067-7
00:53:29.106 --> 00:53:32.579
gets terms through a bank and
pays later or whatever.

6e5e8bdc-f7f4-4246-b4e2-4684d71dc5a3-0
00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:37.115
The what is it the the terms are
not admit to address can be

6e5e8bdc-f7f4-4246-b4e2-4684d71dc5a3-1
00:53:37.115 --> 00:53:41.371
different as well. So like if
they're paying us directly the

6e5e8bdc-f7f4-4246-b4e2-4684d71dc5a3-2
00:53:41.371 --> 00:53:45.139
remit to address the summer
Classics PO Box or or our

6e5e8bdc-f7f4-4246-b4e2-4684d71dc5a3-3
00:53:45.139 --> 00:53:49.604
physical address here. If it's a
factor bank, it's going to say

6e5e8bdc-f7f4-4246-b4e2-4684d71dc5a3-4
00:53:49.604 --> 00:53:53.581
something like Rosenthal and
Rosenthal SE and have their

6e5e8bdc-f7f4-4246-b4e2-4684d71dc5a3-5
00:53:53.581 --> 00:53:57.767
remittance address on it. So
that changes between invoices.

6e5e8bdc-f7f4-4246-b4e2-4684d71dc5a3-6
00:53:57.767 --> 00:54:01.256
Does that make sense? It's
always giving them the

6e5e8bdc-f7f4-4246-b4e2-4684d71dc5a3-7
00:54:01.256 --> 00:54:03.070
instruction of how to pay.

42d3583f-93cd-4621-b24a-227d356a4885-0
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:04.710
And the logo changes.

44f98953-85e4-4c36-a286-ca708f8c71dc-0
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:09.105
That sort of thing though, so
that's typically if you're

44f98953-85e4-4c36-a286-ca708f8c71dc-1
00:54:09.105 --> 00:54:13.232
looking at invoice, it's going
to be in the header level or the

44f98953-85e4-4c36-a286-ca708f8c71dc-2
00:54:13.232 --> 00:54:17.165
foot level of the invoice, but
the middle sections typically

44f98953-85e4-4c36-a286-ca708f8c71dc-3
00:54:17.165 --> 00:54:21.163
stay those columns and those
boxes are about the same I think

44f98953-85e4-4c36-a286-ca708f8c71dc-4
00:54:21.163 --> 00:54:22.260
between each one.

efac28ff-39af-437f-a9cd-0d81ca13a40f-0
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:24.460
And.

598469e4-c532-452e-a1c7-4c3cc87ce2e5-0
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.610
Just to clarify, Syspro prints
that.

932e145d-4dd6-4883-8d10-3565c643a89c-0
00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:33.740
Templated invoice out on its
own.

99ca7a3d-2df5-4476-83aa-5f327bc6279a-0
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:38.796
It has a template built in
somewhere and when David Lang

99ca7a3d-2df5-4476-83aa-5f327bc6279a-1
00:54:38.796 --> 00:54:43.620
was here, he was the kind of our
go to for making changes or at

99ca7a3d-2df5-4476-83aa-5f327bc6279a-2
00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:46.410
any syspro questions just about
and.

7ccc020d-0b04-465e-8896-82fca03ef33b-0
00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:51.229
I believe he was the one I
always went to to say, hey, this

7ccc020d-0b04-465e-8896-82fca03ef33b-1
00:54:51.229 --> 00:54:54.630
remit to address needs to
change. Like right now we have

7ccc020d-0b04-465e-8896-82fca03ef33b-2
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:57.732
Wells Fargo for instance has
changed their lock box

7ccc020d-0b04-465e-8896-82fca03ef33b-3
00:54:57.732 --> 00:55:01.610
information aware customers send
checks directly to our our bank

7ccc020d-0b04-465e-8896-82fca03ef33b-4
00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:05.189
for them to deposit. So I need
to right now, I need to make

7ccc020d-0b04-465e-8896-82fca03ef33b-5
00:55:05.189 --> 00:55:09.067
sure that that has also changed
on our invoices and I had always

7ccc020d-0b04-465e-8896-82fca03ef33b-6
00:55:09.067 --> 00:55:12.706
gone to David Lang and beyond
will know what that means then

7ccc020d-0b04-465e-8896-82fca03ef33b-7
00:55:12.706 --> 00:55:16.107
and he would get that changed
for us and that's where my

7ccc020d-0b04-465e-8896-82fca03ef33b-8
00:55:16.107 --> 00:55:17.420
knowledge of it ended.

f29940ce-6b39-4492-87c3-24b963d76168-0
00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:23.390
But Umm, but I think the logos
the same way. There's a way to

f29940ce-6b39-4492-87c3-24b963d76168-1
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:27.769
correct the logo because like
summer classics I'm sure we're

f29940ce-6b39-4492-87c3-24b963d76168-2
00:55:27.769 --> 00:55:32.292
going to want our updated logo
for yet that marketing has just

f29940ce-6b39-4492-87c3-24b963d76168-3
00:55:32.292 --> 00:55:36.886
rolled out and or you know and
then I was telling Stephanie and

f29940ce-6b39-4492-87c3-24b963d76168-4
00:55:36.886 --> 00:55:40.691
I kind of showed her some
examples that we where our

f29940ce-6b39-4492-87c3-24b963d76168-5
00:55:40.691 --> 00:55:45.285
licensees went from say A 200 to
20 branch specific to now they

f29940ce-6b39-4492-87c3-24b963d76168-6
00:55:45.285 --> 00:55:47.869
are their own branch 250 we put
we.

31a8b08a-9fd4-4219-90f1-78174b3a3934-0
00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:51.625
The company somehow got a logo
on their invoices, but woo, it's

31a8b08a-9fd4-4219-90f1-78174b3a3934-1
00:55:51.625 --> 00:55:55.337
skewed and looks kind of funky.
So we want to get that corrected

31a8b08a-9fd4-4219-90f1-78174b3a3934-2
00:55:55.337 --> 00:55:59.049
so it looks, you know, neat. So
that kind of stuff. So there's a

31a8b08a-9fd4-4219-90f1-78174b3a3934-3
00:55:59.049 --> 00:56:02.247
way to change that and that
might be a bin question too

31a8b08a-9fd4-4219-90f1-78174b3a3934-4
00:56:02.247 --> 00:56:05.731
because I have or or Richard may
know too since he's kind of

31a8b08a-9fd4-4219-90f1-78174b3a3934-5
00:56:05.731 --> 00:56:06.360
assist pro.

040a0ebb-4d45-4f95-afc8-8f439cc3dba7-0
00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:10.932
I'll be getting with both of
them. Perfect. Yeah. So we just

040a0ebb-4d45-4f95-afc8-8f439cc3dba7-1
00:56:10.932 --> 00:56:14.751
want to make sure all that's
updated and correct and I'd be

040a0ebb-4d45-4f95-afc8-8f439cc3dba7-2
00:56:14.751 --> 00:56:15.770
happy to review.

213976b2-7bc2-4c95-91f7-743399f6be4d-0
00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:20.351
The information, if I can get
examples of each one of those, I

213976b2-7bc2-4c95-91f7-743399f6be4d-1
00:56:20.351 --> 00:56:23.780
can tell you if that's still
correct or not, you know, for

213976b2-7bc2-4c95-91f7-743399f6be4d-2
00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.349
that specific invoice type.

630427e1-cf0b-4802-a24d-412ca72f8163-0
00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:26.460
OK.

7b097bd7-81f8-4c60-a2d6-59e210af47d3-0
00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:28.550
Um.

7f19d7ab-66c9-46cc-94c4-b663af03f0e1-0
00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:34.955
Let's see, we only have 4
minutes left. Is there anything

7f19d7ab-66c9-46cc-94c4-b663af03f0e1-1
00:56:34.955 --> 00:56:39.050
else y'all wanna talk through or
that hasn't been?

762bf58b-6721-4764-97c6-cc0419b45581-0
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:41.010
Shown.

5f53b901-3be0-4561-8649-dcc46f2d7d27-0
00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:47.420
No, I mean are you familiar with
the what the what they had

5f53b901-3be0-4561-8649-dcc46f2d7d27-1
00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:48.830
already set up in?

3424fb6d-62bf-4da9-aab2-2d80f9a7eeb2-0
00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:54.343
Document Print, which is a
module in syspro that we use to

3424fb6d-62bf-4da9-aab2-2d80f9a7eeb2-1
00:56:54.343 --> 00:56:56.450
invoice out the SAT's right now.

f7cbb50e-0b49-4889-aab1-0df84f3396a9-0
00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:01.655
I have. I have no clue what. OK,
I don't know if it would be

f7cbb50e-0b49-4889-aab1-0df84f3396a9-1
00:57:01.655 --> 00:57:04.570
helpful to you guys or not, but
that was kind of.

7894a23e-a502-4fb4-9c77-7010f32f874b-0
00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:09.550
Again, Ben, my answer this
question, he might be like, no,

7894a23e-a502-4fb4-9c77-7010f32f874b-1
00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:13.270
Carla's going down the wrong
path here. But I was thinking if

7894a23e-a502-4fb4-9c77-7010f32f874b-2
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:17.050
we do dispatching, it's probably
going to end up going through

7894a23e-a502-4fb4-9c77-7010f32f874b-3
00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:20.590
that kind of same process that
those do because we we just

7894a23e-a502-4fb4-9c77-7010f32f874b-4
00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:24.250
click through a whole different
module. It's called document

7894a23e-a502-4fb4-9c77-7010f32f874b-5
00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:28.090
print. They have coded a tool in
there for the SET the 100 dash

7894a23e-a502-4fb4-9c77-7010f32f874b-6
00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:31.810
orders that we need to invoice
out. So Ellen goes in and it's

7894a23e-a502-4fb4-9c77-7010f32f874b-7
00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:35.230
just a couple of clicks and
everything. That's 100. Dash

7894a23e-a502-4fb4-9c77-7010f32f874b-8
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.950
will and it.

d9c5899a-d2a1-4356-babe-cf58b58dab4f-0
00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:40.766
Meets the status 7 for ready to
go well in one swoop invoice

d9c5899a-d2a1-4356-babe-cf58b58dab4f-1
00:57:40.766 --> 00:57:45.356
out. So I don't know if they
were thinking or you would be

d9c5899a-d2a1-4356-babe-cf58b58dab4f-2
00:57:45.356 --> 00:57:49.480
using that kind of model for
talking about dispatch.

33f465e5-91f3-44ea-b497-8569e98206ad-0
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:56.052
Whatever I'm trying to say, you
need some more spark and or

33f465e5-91f3-44ea-b497-8569e98206ad-1
00:57:56.052 --> 00:58:00.002
coffee this morning. I'm gonna
share my screen so you can see

33f465e5-91f3-44ea-b497-8569e98206ad-2
00:58:00.002 --> 00:58:03.569
what she's talking about,
Justin. So thank you. I I am.

10f53217-cc0e-4fce-9536-6a4ab3ec89cd-0
00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:08.181
I have you know my favorites
because we use this a lot. So

10f53217-cc0e-4fce-9536-6a4ab3ec89cd-1
00:58:08.181 --> 00:58:12.166
document print and up here in
the document type we would go to

10f53217-cc0e-4fce-9536-6a4ab3ec89cd-2
00:58:12.166 --> 00:58:16.024
dispatch note SCT transfer and
this is built for us and yeah

10f53217-cc0e-4fce-9536-6a4ab3ec89cd-3
00:58:16.024 --> 00:58:19.630
and so this is where we we
invoice those. We can invoice

10f53217-cc0e-4fce-9536-6a4ab3ec89cd-4
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:23.678
them through the system as they
are one by one. But if you come

10f53217-cc0e-4fce-9536-6a4ab3ec89cd-5
00:58:23.678 --> 00:58:27.726
in here you can do them all in
one batch one you know couple of

10f53217-cc0e-4fce-9536-6a4ab3ec89cd-6
00:58:27.726 --> 00:58:31.900
clicks. But I wanted to show you
this because like Carla said she

10f53217-cc0e-4fce-9536-6a4ab3ec89cd-7
00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:35.000
don't know if you'll be able to
use this or not.

327e883d-5e68-43b5-91da-016ef9f140d5-0
00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:38.810
But in the document type it does
have invoice in there.

07399459-d24f-4a38-ab5c-f73b39171380-0
00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:43.516
You know, along with all these
other different things. So I

07399459-d24f-4a38-ab5c-f73b39171380-1
00:58:43.516 --> 00:58:47.416
don't know. Yeah, that's yeah,
that's what I'm thinking too.

07399459-d24f-4a38-ab5c-f73b39171380-2
00:58:47.416 --> 00:58:51.316
Well, the only bad thing about
that though tells me that you

07399459-d24f-4a38-ab5c-f73b39171380-3
00:58:51.316 --> 00:58:55.344
have to define a range or single
or something where unless you

07399459-d24f-4a38-ab5c-f73b39171380-4
00:58:55.344 --> 00:58:59.181
can pull that in from that
information in, if you do an all

07399459-d24f-4a38-ab5c-f73b39171380-5
00:58:59.181 --> 00:59:02.953
or your range, it's going to try
to invoice out everything

07399459-d24f-4a38-ab5c-f73b39171380-6
00:59:02.953 --> 00:59:06.853
whether it has money or not. So
you wouldn't be able to fund

07399459-d24f-4a38-ab5c-f73b39171380-7
00:59:06.853 --> 00:59:08.900
without that other screen. What?

4dceb0ad-58ee-40b4-aa98-2dc01644f078-0
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:12.855
We'd have to come down. Well,
that would be a invoice to

4dceb0ad-58ee-40b4-aa98-2dc01644f078-1
00:59:12.855 --> 00:59:15.370
reprint. We wouldn't be
reprinting them. Um.

f2b22a3b-d09d-4a65-9f06-cde97a4337a8-0
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.960
Yeah, I guess that's where I
maybe all this other stuff comes

f2b22a3b-d09d-4a65-9f06-cde97a4337a8-1
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:23.860
into play. I don't know. But
that's why I leave it to the

f2b22a3b-d09d-4a65-9f06-cde97a4337a8-2
00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:26.910
experts. Yeah. Yeah. Because
I'll let y'all figure that part

f2b22a3b-d09d-4a65-9f06-cde97a4337a8-3
00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:29.910
out. Justin has fun with this
stuff. He loves it. Don't you

f2b22a3b-d09d-4a65-9f06-cde97a4337a8-4
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:30.860
just love it? Yeah.

ffc306db-a52b-48b7-9973-34b7b955b787-0
00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:35.825
Yeah, well, my God too. But
yeah, I don't have the knowledge

ffc306db-a52b-48b7-9973-34b7b955b787-1
00:59:35.825 --> 00:59:39.607
that you have, so there you go.
Voices is in there, so that

ffc306db-a52b-48b7-9973-34b7b955b787-2
00:59:39.607 --> 00:59:43.263
could be an option. Like she
said, we don't know. But you

ffc306db-a52b-48b7-9973-34b7b955b787-3
00:59:43.263 --> 00:59:47.108
know something, I'll get with
Ben and see what this document

ffc306db-a52b-48b7-9973-34b7b955b787-4
00:59:47.108 --> 00:59:48.810
print does on the back end.

d470e3f3-f2a4-49c5-b93f-608f1154e0b4-0
00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:53.734
Be very familiar with the SAT's
and because I'm sure he was part

d470e3f3-f2a4-49c5-b93f-608f1154e0b4-1
00:59:53.734 --> 00:59:57.106
of that coding, if not the one
that did it. Bless him. I hate

d470e3f3-f2a4-49c5-b93f-608f1154e0b4-2
00:59:57.106 --> 00:59:59.010
that we always like ask Ben
Askin.

1d239e38-ab6c-4014-8bdc-928f0e5dd9c6-0
01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.390
The one who knows it all,
though.

a641fa80-d196-4773-a3b3-4a8a2858e6ce-0
01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:06.971
Or go like on a cruise and
decide to stay in the Bahamas

a641fa80-d196-4773-a3b3-4a8a2858e6ce-1
01:00:06.971 --> 01:00:09.140
forever because we'll be like,
what?

a7445881-91a2-4e8c-9f3e-2ac1fe54a4ec-0
01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:17.093
One that's been here as long as
been or maybe longer than Ben is

a7445881-91a2-4e8c-9f3e-2ac1fe54a4ec-1
01:00:17.093 --> 01:00:19.610
Jeff Fagan. Yeah. So Ben.

a0351df4-c6cc-4af9-b15d-e0051dbf14fb-0
01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:23.370
Historical and syspro so.

d95537ea-5e82-41d5-8459-2cdb67892432-0

Um, yeah. So we're all willing
to help with anything. Just let

d95537ea-5e82-41d5-8459-2cdb67892432-1
01:00:29.269 --> 01:00:31.120
us know if there's something you
know.

f539730c-c66e-4c63-862c-8522b411ea93-0
01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:33.370
So uh.

800b3ec4-6a67-4168-8ad0-c60c1cdea4e0-0
01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.570
Just to go over some items, um.

39fce552-1bbe-4229-a577-610a2565ab2f-0
01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:43.500
Y'all will give me some process
documents and then uh.

dfb2b12e-6473-43d6-8fc1-4c4a6eabfd49-0

614f90cd-8790-4c8c-9097-d9b2b6ce61ec-0
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:53.355
Invoicing video that you're
doing with Ben. So what I'll do

614f90cd-8790-4c8c-9097-d9b2b6ce61ec-1
01:00:53.355 --> 01:00:57.243
is help. I had to confirm with
Ben like how to even do that. So

614f90cd-8790-4c8c-9097-d9b2b6ce61ec-2
01:00:57.243 --> 01:01:00.888
I did do that earlier Carla,
when I emailed him. So what he

614f90cd-8790-4c8c-9097-d9b2b6ce61ec-3
01:01:00.888 --> 01:01:04.230
told me to do, he said to
schedule a teams meeting and

614f90cd-8790-4c8c-9097-d9b2b6ce61ec-4
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:07.632
schedule it with him and
Richard. So I can just add you

614f90cd-8790-4c8c-9097-d9b2b6ce61ec-5
01:01:07.632 --> 01:01:11.459
as well Justin. And he said they
won't join, but after I start

614f90cd-8790-4c8c-9097-d9b2b6ce61ec-6
01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:15.226
the meeting and hit record he
said once I'm done then they'll

614f90cd-8790-4c8c-9097-d9b2b6ce61ec-7
01:01:15.226 --> 01:01:16.320
have access to it.

01cbc48e-725c-4596-b986-e47b76e38c62-0
01:01:18.450 --> 01:01:22.307
Process documents, the video I
can get with you on the

01cbc48e-725c-4596-b986-e47b76e38c62-1
01:01:22.307 --> 01:01:26.585
invoices, Justin, and I'll give
you a list of those terms of

01cbc48e-725c-4596-b986-e47b76e38c62-2
01:01:26.585 --> 01:01:29.109
what's money, not money. Top
terms.

98bf845b-cfbf-424e-b8dd-08e6cf862bd7-0
01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:34.465
Yeah. And then I'll get back
with y'all about the marketing

98bf845b-cfbf-424e-b8dd-08e6cf862bd7-1
01:01:34.465 --> 01:01:34.970
orders.

3a4e0678-547b-4f52-bf51-fa255da1b808-0
01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:37.700
So OK.

0577c8f8-19a8-4fb1-8160-0788a9605c7b-0
01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:39.140
Um.

7e1f487c-16b7-4761-9d89-cc9a9d78b465-0
01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:45.378
With additional questions and
things, once you're kind of able

7e1f487c-16b7-4761-9d89-cc9a9d78b465-1
01:01:45.378 --> 01:01:49.786
to like what we can and can't
do, if there's some sort of

7e1f487c-16b7-4761-9d89-cc9a9d78b465-2
01:01:49.786 --> 01:01:54.422
setting that's preventing the
marketing orders to be to flow

7e1f487c-16b7-4761-9d89-cc9a9d78b465-3
01:01:54.422 --> 01:01:58.906
through dispatch note so that
the whole ticket transfer to

7e1f487c-16b7-4761-9d89-cc9a9d78b465-4
01:01:58.906 --> 01:01:59.590
y'all is.

6440e9af-bb65-4a54-8d82-8d0678eeb920-0
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:04.020
Outdated. Yeah, yeah. Um.

805dd4d3-e174-44a7-a352-55844d3ac571-0
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:06.780
So I found my invoice in notes.

5a74724a-975f-4781-a0a2-94fe8cdb3080-0
01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:11.461
Yeah, we'll get them too,
because we need to review those

5a74724a-975f-4781-a0a2-94fe8cdb3080-1
01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:15.170
trash and make sure that they're
clear as mud for Justin. Yeah,

5a74724a-975f-4781-a0a2-94fe8cdb3080-2
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:16.330
yeah, they're basic.

a048ce4f-8c63-4080-8bd3-3869967cdaa4-0
01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.612
OK. Thank you so much. Yeah,
thank you so much. So once you

a048ce4f-8c63-4080-8bd3-3869967cdaa4-1
01:02:21.612 --> 01:02:25.204
get all that information sent
out and everybody has a chance

a048ce4f-8c63-4080-8bd3-3869967cdaa4-2
01:02:25.204 --> 01:02:29.031
to review it, if we need to then
have another meeting to go over

a048ce4f-8c63-4080-8bd3-3869967cdaa4-3
01:02:29.031 --> 01:02:32.799
just and get all your questions
and and go from there. Just let

a048ce4f-8c63-4080-8bd3-3869967cdaa4-4
01:02:32.799 --> 01:02:35.390
me know we can definitely get it
scheduled.

941085d4-b7dd-4d1d-8eb4-d9560024a8a6-0
01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:41.354
Sounds great. Thank you,
everybody. Thank you. Thank you.

941085d4-b7dd-4d1d-8eb4-d9560024a8a6-1
