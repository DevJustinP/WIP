1 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
Okay, smart something.

2 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:07.200
1 of them contains your registration number and your, um.

3 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.589
The 2 registration pieces for.

4 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:16.709
Accessing the, um, the Smarty system.

5 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:00:16.709 --> 00:00:24.600
Okay, and the other 1 is storing what storing valid addresses that I found. And so.

6 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:33.540
I don't do a call this Marty if I already find him that I've already verified him and that that address is good and it doesn't matter if that address was 4.

7 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:45.660
A customer, and the same address is used for a supplier. The same dress used for a different customer. If it finds the address, it knows it's good because it's already verified it through.

8 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.080
Through the call, cause you guys didn't want to call every time.

9 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.000
Did you pay on it per.

10 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.070
Transaction basis I believe it's important.

11 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:07.470
There we go, um, so also, if there's there's a button that.

12 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.650
You push to check the address if you want to if you have another, if it has never been checked.

13 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.830
And also a button to update.

14 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:26.430
You're working with the customer and you check the address and it's different because sometimes all you have to do is put a zip code in in the city and state will pop in automatically. You don't have to type the.

15 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.720
And then you can click the update button and boom, it'll put it back in the screens. So when you save the customer, that's all saved with it.

16 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.230
And the address that we just verified is saved.

17 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.090
So the next time you go in there to look into just pop up on the bottom valid address.

18 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:53.280
Uh, what else is cool about this and when it's attached to sales orders, there is no bill to address.

19 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:04.260
And so you'll see, that's blank, but, you know, if you added a ship to a different ship to address or something like that, that's where it's going to pop it out. I haven't.

20 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.670
The only thing I just thought of now, I didn't test a lot with multiple ship tools.

21 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.360
But I do believe if you pick 1, it fills it into the sales order screen. And so then it'll still pop up.

22 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.710
So, what happens is, is, let's say that you have a customer.

23 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:32.340
And you have the bill to address, and they say, oh, I want to change this address to blah, blah, blah for a Dropbox lock or a different office, or something like that. And you change your address on the screen.

24 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.780
Then over in my little pain, those changes you made will show up in red, and it'll again ask you to check the address.

25 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.800
So, then you click the check dress button and if it's good, then it comes back.

26 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.970
If the addresses bad, Smarty sends back nothing.

27 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.560
And I'll just show you invalid address it. It's I'm, I'm not real thrilled with that, but that's how they do it.

28 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.230
And it doesn't prompt me for things. Okay Pre uh, where are you.

29 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.870
Yes, I am copying the link right now.

30 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.690
Okay, I can share fine to say all of it.

31 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:27.060
What was it? So through 1 of you I'm gonna have to get at the system.

32 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.380
Probably whoever's the most powerful.

33 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:43.170
Okay.

34 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.910
So, are you are you guys located again Florida.

35 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:03:50.910 --> 00:04:00.840
I'm not sure if the chat will work, but I'll try here. 1st and Central. I'm going to send you the list, the link so you can forward it.

36 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.730
Okay, thanks but let's say within, uh, within the.

37 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.540
Chat and 1 of you open it up.

38 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.660
Ben, can you open that link? Yeah, I'm done now.

39 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:31.109
There are different license levels that you can get.

40 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:34.289
With Smarty, I don't know if we knew this, but there's.

41 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:40.439
An international license you can get, and there's some other prompting licenses.

42 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:48.029
I didn't play with those cause I just did the 1 that you guys have, but I do know that there's an international license and I'm guessing that that works the same.

43 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:56.399
The only difference would be that it'll verify addresses in Germany or England or Canada. I don't know if you do sales in those places or not.

44 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:04:56.399 --> 00:05:02.429
Not really, we got it figured out us covers the, most of our.

45 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:16.854
Yep, and if you flip an international, usually you're pretty careful to make sure that address is correct. And so it will say invalid address, but just ignore that because you don't have to if it says invalid address that doesn't mean you can't use the address.

46 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:05:16.854 --> 00:05:19.584
It just means that Smarty doesn't have it yet.

47 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:05:19.859 --> 00:05:23.369
Like, we talked about a new development, a new.

48 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:26.789
Industrial park or something that no, you guys want to.

49 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.909
But you still do retailers, right?

50 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:34.469
All to all of the above.

51 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:38.759
Okay, it's not on anybody.

52 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:13.739
Coming down slowly all. Let me share my screen here.

53 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:35.849
Can everybody see my screen.

54 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:42.839
Wait a minute latest. What file do we have in there? What file did you download? It show me the file.

55 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:06:46.109 --> 00:06:52.379
The file was this is a folder.

56 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:57.239
That isn't what I Pre what where did you get that? 1 from.

57 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:03.659
Okay, um, this file.

58 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:06.659
Yeah.

59 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:10.409
I got it from my feet right?

60 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:19.319
It's not letting you extract files from there.

61 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:24.389
No, it's, it's a block. That's amazing.

62 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:32.579
Did you copy the Smarty address install package 200 and and 2 2.

63 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:37.229
Yes, I renamed it.

64 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:45.719
So, I put I copied the wrong 1 to you. I'm sorry.

65 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:51.689
Yeah, I, I'm not sure. Yeah, it has got to paint.

66 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:56.759
Right. It's it was this read me.

67 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:08.399
It is 6, 1 city.

68 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:11.729
The 1 that the real 1 has 3.

69 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:15.779
Directories.

70 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:21.659
So, majority of it is like, sequel, custom paints and installing sections and.

71 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:24.899
I believe you are oh, this is the 1.

Um, I just put 1 on your machine.

73 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:08:32.129 --> 00:08:36.089
Which is a classic address, it says dash copy, but.

74 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:43.889
Did you copy the whole all all the files or just? Yep.

75 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:59.999
I'm going to name it. I named it good summer classics.

76 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:08:59.999 --> 00:09:03.539
Mm, hmm let me find it.

77 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:09:04.829 --> 00:09:08.339
Okay, copy it again on my.

00:10:33.449 --> 00:10:41.729
You pronounce your name Kathryn Kathryn.

81 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:10:41.729 --> 00:10:46.259
Okay, I just I had said your name I just didn't want to be wrong.

82 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:11:04.979 --> 00:11:10.079
No.

83 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:11:11.909 --> 00:11:16.469
Put it in chat again.

84 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:11:16.469 --> 00:11:22.169
Let's try that 1.

85 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:11:22.169 --> 00:11:25.619
Central, and I'm going to send you another email.

86 "Shantrell Joubert" (1921993472)
00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:30.659
Okay, I'll delete the old 1. yeah, I'll send another 1.

87 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:12:00.624 --> 00:12:00.954
Then.

88 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:12:39.419 --> 00:12:44.429
That's better okay. If we can just.

89 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:52.409
Um, have those 2 we have to to bring in to the SQL management.

90 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:12:52.434 --> 00:13:07.254
Object management there you go. Um, okay. Which company are you using? Cisco company 100. is that the 1? We're going to install this on? Yeah. yeah

91 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:13:08.004 --> 00:13:08.544
Okay,

92 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:13:24.264 --> 00:13:27.954
I'm just making a special, um, user.

93 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:13:28.229 --> 00:13:33.539
So, that I don't have to have you put everything in? As long as we have the user there.

94 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:13:33.539 --> 00:13:38.339
No matter which company you have the system will be smart enough.

95 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:13:41.339 --> 00:13:51.269
What, Ah, yeah, it's gonna have to be longer for our password requirements.

96 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:13:55.229 --> 00:13:59.489
Um, what does it have to be.

97 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:14:02.789 --> 00:14:06.029
I think if you go down to security, you should be able to.

98 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:14:06.029 --> 00:14:09.809
Um, edit this user.

99 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:15.899
Oh, you made it smarter Cisco. Okay. Yeah. Let's.

100 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:18.959
It's, um.

101 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:14:26.369 --> 00:14:31.199
The same is what I okay, so we won't be able to test it right away, but that's okay.

102 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:35.969
And the tables are created. Yeah.

103 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:14:35.969 --> 00:14:41.129
Okay, let's go to the, let's open up the.

104 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:14:41.129 --> 00:14:44.609
Uh, they're way at the bottom at the bottom bottom.

105 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:14:47.489 --> 00:14:52.589
Yep, yep let's open up Smarty control. Right click and say, add it.

106 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:14:54.989 --> 00:15:03.209
Oh, we want to edit cause there isn't any roles and we wanted to put something in because I'm going to let you put your your registration things in right away.

107 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:15:03.474 --> 00:15:04.044
Um,

108 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:15:17.514 --> 00:15:18.684
let me see.

109 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:15:20.729 --> 00:15:24.719
Okay, the Smarty ID and the token they should be.

110 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:15:24.719 --> 00:15:29.909
They should, you should have those both pretty long. I op ID is really long.

111 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:15:29.909 --> 00:15:39.089
And the token isn't quite as bad central could could you please record the meeting?

112 "Shantrell Joubert" (1921993472)
00:15:39.089 --> 00:15:45.929
I am I made a start a little bit early, but it's recording. All right. Perfect. I just wanted to take.

113 "Priya Gupta" (4055928320)
00:15:45.929 --> 00:15:49.829
I hope it is. Fine with you. All yeah.

114 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:15:52.764 --> 00:15:53.244
Thank you,

115 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:16:12.714 --> 00:16:13.764
um, the 1st.

116 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:16:14.009 --> 00:16:20.399
If if you have your, the very 1st field has to be capital C, capital T, capital.

117 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:26.999
And then, yeah, it's 1 of those numbers.

118 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:16:34.649 --> 00:16:41.639
I don't think we're gonna be able to test it because until I change the program with that new password, but we can get it all installed.

119 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:16:43.049 --> 00:16:51.779
Let's see if it'll let me change it. Um, and oh, I see I'll pass the, uh.

120 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:58.229
What was the, uh, just Pro, USA user? I believe Smarty.

121 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:17:12.389 --> 00:17:16.679
Why is that?

122 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:17:18.629 --> 00:17:20.544
It is this Pro USA cost

123 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:17:44.004 --> 00:17:45.414
starting with the dollar sign.

124 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:17:46.554 --> 00:17:47.214
Okay,

125 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:09.954
let's change it. Let's see if we can do a new, um.

126 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:18:10.229 --> 00:18:13.499
Connection and sign in with that.

127 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:18:22.679 --> 00:18:27.659
Uh, what was it? Cisco, USA.

128 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:18:27.954 --> 00:18:28.194
Okay.

129 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:18:47.729 --> 00:18:52.349
Yep, it did. Let's make sure we can.

130 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:18:52.349 --> 00:18:59.909
Get those 2 tables 2, new ones.

131 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:19:08.069 --> 00:19:20.129
Let's try and edit them because I'm gonna be updating, em, not just looking at them.

132 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:19:24.689 --> 00:19:30.359
Let's try and change the to, or just make another role. We can delete it then.

133 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:37.019
Okay.

134 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:42.899
All right, we have to find there.

135 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:19:45.689 --> 00:19:53.219
Okay, are the other files on this machine? We don't need sq open anymore. Oh, yeah.

136 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:19:53.219 --> 00:19:59.069
So, if we can put this over in the corner or something.

137 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:19:59.069 --> 00:20:07.319
Um, actually go to your your file and go to manage assembly space, manage assemblies and.

138 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:20:18.719 --> 00:20:31.889
Okay, the top 1 is the 1 that I wrote that controls your stuff.

139 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:20:31.889 --> 00:20:35.699
And the 2nd, 1, that's the Smarty street. Scott dash dot net.

140 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:20:35.699 --> 00:20:42.179
Et cetera, that's 1 that they furnished. So what I do is, I basically call their.

141 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:48.689
Routines and then they talk to their to their databases and things and then they return back to me.

142 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:20:48.689 --> 00:20:52.019
So, that that's required to be in there.

143 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:20:52.019 --> 00:20:57.869
Okay. Um, all right.

144 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:20:57.869 --> 00:21:04.439
Hm. Nice. It was well, yeah, we kept the.

145 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:21:04.439 --> 00:21:08.519
When we did the upgrade left, the folder name the same. Okay. Okay.

146 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:21.449
Somebody does here. Okay, let's open the.

147 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:32.159
And let's go to accounts receivable.

148 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:43.769
Customer set up customers. This is good because you'll have to put this in for other companies. If you, if you decide to cause these are my company.

149 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:49.049
Um, just right click, like, on customer details.

150 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:21:55.859 --> 00:22:00.419
Customize pain. Oh, you have to turn on the designer.

151 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:10.469
Okay.

152 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:22:34.374 --> 00:22:40.224
Yeah, we don't have the I don't have it didn't make an important 1. I figured we'd make it so we're gonna have to go into, um.

153 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:43.649
Administration and design the menus.

154 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:22:45.869 --> 00:22:52.709
Cause it won't let you do a new 1 here and I would, I would just.

155 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:22:52.709 --> 00:22:56.789
This should probably just be for everybody.

156 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:22:56.789 --> 00:23:00.419
What do you think? Yeah.

157 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:23:01.439 --> 00:23:06.659
Okay.

158 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:23:13.439 --> 00:23:19.619
Okay, now go to customers new.

159 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:29.099
Window title can be what I always called it address verification, but you can call it whatever you want.

160 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:23:31.589 --> 00:23:35.429
The 2nd 1 is that net user control and the drop down.

161 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:23:38.009 --> 00:23:49.559
And the initial docking position, I made it flow because then if somebody's using it, and they have 2 monitors, they can get this out of their way. And they don't have to have it within the screen. And they could always drag it in.

162 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:23:51.239 --> 00:23:55.439
And this is only the initial 1 once they changed and put it where they want to then.

163 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:23:55.439 --> 00:23:59.969
Um, ignores it now. Okay. Yeah, you'll see.

164 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:23:59.969 --> 00:24:09.089
Um, go down to assembly name. Uh, no we want to go to.

165 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:24:13.709 --> 00:24:19.229
Should be going into the, the, um, base manage assemblies folder.

166 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:24:21.899 --> 00:24:30.989
Does that get copied over to the client?

167 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:24:30.989 --> 00:24:35.999
It should have.

168 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:24:35.999 --> 00:24:39.539
I was already logged in, so, let me close out.

169 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:25:23.994 --> 00:25:24.174
Huh.

170 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:25:24.509 --> 00:25:38.489
Yep, I hate when people are watching.

171 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:26:18.534 --> 00:26:19.224
Oh, yeah.

172 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:26:25.739 --> 00:26:28.799
Uh, this 1.

173 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:37.229
Mm, hmm. And change the assembly name space to.

174 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:26:37.229 --> 00:26:42.029
With the drop down for that, uh, user control 1 to bottom 1.

175 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:46.949
And change the namespace method to link from form.

176 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:26:48.239 --> 00:26:51.539
Okay, go to edit BB script.

177 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:26:51.539 --> 00:26:56.939
Up on the top.

178 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:26:56.939 --> 00:27:00.449
And now let's go to our, our folder with our files.

179 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:09.809
They are, um, uh, open either. 1. I don't know I'll open the top 1. yeah, that should be the 1.

180 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:27:12.749 --> 00:27:20.279
Yep, copy all this pasted here.

181 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:27:22.079 --> 00:27:30.299
And do a quick syntax check and then save. No, there wasn't gonna be an error, but that's just how I always do it.

182 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:27:30.299 --> 00:27:37.259
Um, now I can just save and exit. Here's what the screen looks like.

183 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:44.429
Um, I, you can you can take the edge and move it closer. I made it smaller today.

184 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:27:44.429 --> 00:27:50.699
Because it, it seemed to be too big, but you can, you can, you can size.

185 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:27:50.699 --> 00:27:54.449
The window how you want to? Yep, it's moving.

186 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:27:59.489 --> 00:28:02.819
Okay, Here's what you had, right?

187 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:28:02.819 --> 00:28:06.389
Now, in there, so.

188 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:13.949
I don't know how often you have to get new authorizations. That's why I put this in. Okay you have to put a new 1 in. That's just all you have to do to get it.

189 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:28:15.749 --> 00:28:22.709
So, let's do 1 more thing let's go to right? Click on street address. 1.

190 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:33.059
Add 2 Yep go back to our file.

191 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:28:36.839 --> 00:28:47.939
Not that 1 the other 1 we're gonna have to do the other 1 no just do control a.

192 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:28:50.459 --> 00:29:02.909
Control C, okay what this basically does Ben is whenever an address changes.

193 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:29:03.929 --> 00:29:07.649
It triggers that, so you should be able to pick a customer.

194 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:29:11.129 --> 00:29:14.429
Huh.

195 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:29:25.289 --> 00:29:28.769
Oh, what did we name it? Renamed it something different.

196 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:29:30.239 --> 00:29:33.509
No, I thought you needed to address verification.

197 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:29:39.419 --> 00:29:48.239
Nope, I'm not spelled it. Oh, oh, yeah if you want it.

198 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:29:53.369 --> 00:29:58.739
Uh, you have to do the edit window title. There you go. Did you click that you know.

199 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:30:03.299 --> 00:30:08.849
I don't Danny. No space like everyone in the space? No, no it'll take the space out.

200 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:30:08.849 --> 00:30:12.239
Automatically.

201 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:30:12.239 --> 00:30:16.319
Okay.

202 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:30:18.749 --> 00:30:24.419
We might have to get out, get back in.

203 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:30:24.419 --> 00:30:29.039
Nope, you don't want to do that.

204 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:30:49.409 --> 00:31:02.609
Oh, wait.

205 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:31:21.779 --> 00:31:26.429
Okay.

206 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:31:28.349 --> 00:31:33.179
See, what it has over here. Mm. Hmm. As the ship address.

207 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:31:33.179 --> 00:31:37.109
Just for the sole address, who just says or set.

208 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:42.659
Do not use, you can click check address and.

209 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:31:47.099 --> 00:31:50.189
Oh, it doesn't like.

210 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:31:50.189 --> 00:31:56.189
Only having floors that if floor said, I think, would have been on street address 1 instead of do not use.

211 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:31:57.329 --> 00:32:00.539
Been okay, so.

212 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:32:00.539 --> 00:32:09.179
I want to look and see how you're doing your, how you're doing your addresses.

213 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:32:11.369 --> 00:32:14.369
It's a normal Yep.

214 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:32:16.169 --> 00:32:27.599
See, how it came back valid and it changed it changed. It changed it. Instead of Hoover, it put Hoover because.

215 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:32:27.599 --> 00:32:34.049
The 1st line is the address line 1, the 2nd line is like, sweet or something or whatever.

216 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:32:34.049 --> 00:32:38.579
The 3rd line is the city, uh, the 4th line is the state.

217 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:32:39.929 --> 00:32:44.579
And, uh, zip code goes in the zip. Uh.

218 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:32:44.579 --> 00:32:52.199
If you update the, it's gonna.

219 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:32:53.459 --> 00:32:57.329
So you'll have to do a little bit of the changing in here.

220 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:32:57.329 --> 00:33:00.629
In order to do that where it heads. So now it says, do not use.

221 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:33:00.629 --> 00:33:04.589
I'd make that state. Um, mm. Hmm. Yeah.

222 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:33:04.589 --> 00:33:10.349
Something, you know, you understand, I couldn't didn't know how.

223 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:33:10.349 --> 00:33:16.469
How else to do it so I just left it with this the way you normally do with the addresses.

224 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:33:18.689 --> 00:33:26.099
It helps when I thought of, but it was going to take too long, it's to go after how you do the address, and then map it together and stuff but that was gonna take a while.

225 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:33:29.189 --> 00:33:34.409
That's all there is to it. Okay now, when you close out the customer.

226 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:33:37.169 --> 00:33:46.439
Hello.

227 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:33:59.309 --> 00:34:04.709
We didn't save it why it was asking for that other thing.

228 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:34:12.689 --> 00:34:18.989
There it's saved it, so if you just click tab or hit enter again.

229 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:26.039
That's I mean.

230 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:34:27.749 --> 00:34:37.529
Now, if you wanted to drag this address verification, somewhere into your HR customer maintenance, wherever you put it just like any other pain, that's where it'll stay.

231 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:34:37.529 --> 00:34:48.419
I just kinda liked it outside of there, but you can, you can't go, um, on the edge and move it in toward the update address. Mm. Hmm.

232 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:52.049
Make it the size you want it?

233 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:34:52.049 --> 00:34:55.259
Now, to be honest.

234 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:34:55.259 --> 00:35:01.889
And sales orders work. Exactly. The same way. The only difference is sales orders.

235 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:35:01.889 --> 00:35:06.299
Are do not have a billing address to them only a shipping address.

236 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:35:06.299 --> 00:35:11.549
And the AP has a physical address and a remit address.

237 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:35:15.539 --> 00:35:27.209
Was definitely differences. And so what we need to do is we just need to take we need to create the custom pain in each of those 2 things and then, um, copy in the macros just like we did.

238 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:35:27.209 --> 00:35:40.019
Copy the script, can we put a check in for this?

239 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:35:40.019 --> 00:35:44.489
Well, you have you have to have a street address I just saw it.

240 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:35:44.489 --> 00:35:47.789
Fails gracefully instead of.

241 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:35:47.789 --> 00:35:52.889
See, it says it lack the street address, but I can change that. If you want.

242 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:35:55.769 --> 00:35:59.909
In fact, I can do the editing ahead of time and make a note here.

243 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:35:59.909 --> 00:36:12.749
At a minimum you have to have the, uh, street address address line 1.

244 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:36:12.749 --> 00:36:19.349
And also the zip code that's that's the minimum you need. And it'll, it'll figure everything else out from there.

245 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:24.539
So, if you take out the start, Starkville, Mississippi.

246 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:32.039
Oh, I got it.

247 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:36:34.019 --> 00:36:42.719
That go straight street field. Oh, that's because of the ship address.

248 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:36:45.869 --> 00:36:49.529
Uh, I'll put those edits in. Okay.

249 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:37:00.749 --> 00:37:05.399
It doesn't like either of them. Yeah, it's not a real address, but.

250 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:37:05.399 --> 00:37:13.079
We're not just popped up invalid address there and I have that on the bottom instead of having it in the middle. So that.

251 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:37:14.789 --> 00:37:19.889
Because if I had it in the middle and you clicked update by accident now, right now, if you click update.

252 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:37:20.909 --> 00:37:29.849
It's going to change it the blanks you can do it. Well, it didn't change it to blank.

253 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:37:47.724 --> 00:37:48.444
There you go now.

254 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:37:55.769 --> 00:38:03.509
And it didn't change it. It didn't change that 1 because that's invalid.

255 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:38:03.509 --> 00:38:15.270
I mean, it's smart enough go back to the 1 that we did the 1st time.

256 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:22.350
Hello.

257 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:32.430
I think it was 17, wasn't it?

258 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:46.380
It already says valid address. You give me enough to check it. It, it knows that it's a valid address because we started in that table with the addresses. So it doesn't have to go out to Smarty.

259 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:55.350
Does that make sense? Yeah, that's, uh.

260 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:06.720
Yep, the, uh, that 1, the other ones, we're all a little bit different.

261 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:21.120
So, it's just checking is it here? Yep, well, it's checking both sides, but it really it checks here. 1st time.

262 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.960
Because if there's nothing there, and it came up, um.

263 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:37.470
No, it's not going to say it's valid. You can override it, but I'm not gonna I'm not assuming that it's right because you come in again. It's like, hey, let's check this again. Maybe they have it now or something.

264 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:42.810
Yeah, this table you don't have to really worry about it'll take care of itself.

265 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:56.310
The only reason that I have it for the checking, the other thing you can do is you could look at it and say, what was my old address, you know, find the 1 that you just did.

266 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:59.460
Because you did it wrong and find the old address and and.

267 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:04.140
You know what it was it's kind of an audit trail, but it's really used for that.

268 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:10.110
Avoiding using Smarty? Yeah. Okay.

269 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:15.810
So you want to install it the other places? Yeah.

270 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:32.070
And so it used to working, just on my machine and things so much faster.

271 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:40.740
I didn't do it for for a quick entry.

272 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:45.780
Sales and entry express. That's fine. We don't use that. That's fine.

273 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:51.540
You would do the same thing that we're doing here, except you're, you'd have to change some variable names and things.

274 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:57.840
Got it so anywhere you want to you right? Click. Yep.

275 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:15.690
It'll list out the same way. If you forget to go float it doesn't really matter.

276 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:41:16.495 --> 00:41:30.625
There it is now, this baby scripts, a little different than the other ones we have to open it up under the AP.

277 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:35.700
Or, yeah, and it's, uh, the 4,000.

278 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:43.830
Now, I have comments some stuff out. Okay.

279 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:49.200
Because I took it from the.

280 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:42:03.775 --> 00:42:07.705
Now it just right click within the pain that has the addresses.

281 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:17.220
The other 1.

282 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:25.230
They're pretty cool. All these scripts are pretty close to the same, but they have different names.

283 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:35.760
Different people broke the different things.

284 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:42:36.505 --> 00:42:36.655
Hello.

285 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:29.010
Eastern timing yeah, we're Central.

286 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:41.580
You're in Alabama, right?

287 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:51.510
Oh, I gotta take those 2 out. We'll do that in a 2nd.

288 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:43:51.510 --> 00:44:05.550
I was testing something you can just say, okay, this 1 does have built this. Mine didn't have a.

289 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:44:06.415 --> 00:44:20.575
So, you must be including it in your in your pain and I didn't have it in my pain. So it's in that customer information on. Yep. And if, and if you didn't have that there, you know, if you didn't show it, it would still work. It would just be blank.

290 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:26.940
I'm there. Mm. Hmm.

291 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:42.780
You make more of those.

292 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:52.890
That's because I didn't have the other. Okay. You can say, okay, I wrote it down.

293 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.930
There's probably something that it's probably gonna pop it up a few times.

294 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:05.850
I don't I don't need it. I wrote it down. Okay.

295 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:19.920
So, we need to edit the script on that. Yep.

296 "Richard Bentley" (3047046400)
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:25.410
Yep, so.

297 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:29.400
No, not yeah, you have to do.

298 "Richard Bentley" (3047046400)
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:33.720
What I was going to ask when you click update.

299 "Richard Bentley" (3047046400)
00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:37.860
When you're in the sales order there, does it only update the sales order? Or is it.

300 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:41.940
That make the customer take it only updates the sales order.

301 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:46.620
I wasn't smart enough. I figured that you guys would never be changing.

302 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:53.340
The bill to address, but yeah, you're right. It doesn't update the customer.

303 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.530
Mm, hmm right. Click in uh.

304 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:18.870
Oh, wait, no, this, this 1 you're okay. Go to over under field properties. Click the variable tab variables tab.

305 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:25.170
Yep, and go to, uh, customer information.

306 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.700
Okay, well we have to do is we have to.

307 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:39.840
I like the 1st, half of line 22 where it says contact details, code, objects, ship address 1.

308 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:48.540
And then, um, double click on the, or yeah, double click on the address. 1.

309 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:56.610
In the in the other pain, and then the same thing with the other, it was address 2 and 3.

310 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:12.060
And I don't ever do address 3. I don't ever use that 1. I have no clue what that.

311 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:18.540
Truly for, and this should be the post, uh, the zip code postal code. Yep.

312 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:24.840
That's it just do a syntax check and save it and the way we go.

313 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:33.330
Hello.

314 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:45.120
How many transactions do you guys have a month? Did you or do you have an unlimited plan?

315 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:52.170
Um, it was, I think we went with the yearly, it's like, 1.8Million or something.

316 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:57.960
Okay, um, each 1 of these is a 2 is 2.

317 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.990
Because it's 2 addresses.

318 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:05.520
Okay, so we really only have 500,000.

319 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:14.250
And are you checking the address type that custom field?

320 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:17.340
No, I'm not doing anything with custom fields.

321 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:26.100
Yeah, we'll, we'll need to add that then.

322 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:48:44.515 --> 00:48:46.345
Oh, we shouldn't change that 1. we were in there.

323 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:55.800
Changed it.

324 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:59.460
Hello.

325 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:13.320
So, I don't I don't really check. So, what do we need to do on sales orders to only check.

326 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:18.150
Um, the ship too, I guess.

327 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:24.540
I think if you go into or not, cause most of our transactions are going to be sales order entry.

328 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:29.100
Right. So we're not doubling up on the API calls. Well.

329 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:32.940
I mean, the next time you go in, it's going to just say, valid address for both.

330 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:43.110
And actually, if the to address is already correct in there, then you won't have to check the address because it'll pop up valid because it's in that other table.

331 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:48.180
Gotcha. Okay. Bye.

332 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:59.460
And again, this can be moved wherever you want it to on the.

333 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:05.070
For the pain and by person, like, we'll get rid of that as soon as.

334 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:22.560
I changed it backwards on this 1.

335 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:33.570
Thanks.

336 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:41.130
Go back in there. Please. Oh, yeah. Here right?

337 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:48.930
I do know, you can go find these and and if you have to edit them, you should never have to edit on.

338 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:52.500
But if you do, you don't have to go through Cisco.

339 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:56.040
It's probably just a little safer to do it that way.

340 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:04.980
And just right click in the order. Header. Nope. Nope.

341 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:09.690
Yep.

342 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:17.790
And see the 1st, 97 and line 8, get rid of those 2.

343 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.980
You guys have just a couple of companies.

344 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:19.770
Are they all used? No um.

345 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:23.250
We did a consolidation when we went to 7.

346 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:34.050
Where you could do true branch cause in 6, you couldn't really do down to the income statement level. So, um, we combined, I think.

347 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:40.350
20 companies in the 1 and then we combine.

348 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:47.880
6 companies and didn't want to end do another 1. so we only have 2 active the rest. We just okay.

349 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:51.150
For historical.

350 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.120
Right.

351 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:13.740
Just go down to the zip and put yourself and put this in.

352 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:28.890
I was wondering if that will pick up on.

353 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:38.070
See, how it filled it in now? Yeah.

354 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:50.040
Do it.

355 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:54:08.695 --> 00:54:08.965
Okay.

356 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:15.180
Look at the billing address and let's make sure it didn't update that. 1.

357 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:21.780
Oh, no, I mean, under the sole too, in that pane, uh, it's blank.

358 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:39.060
It doesn't billing billing address.

359 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:42.060
Check that make sure that it works.

360 "Richard Bentley" (3047046400)
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:49.710
Right.

361 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:37.350
Hello.

362 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:55:50.490 --> 00:56:00.330
Hello.

363 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:10.020
Huh.

364 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:14.550
Oh, or is that already like that?

365 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:24.750
That was already like that, cause that's just 3 Apple for growth and then we had 303.

366 "Richard Bentley" (3047046400)
00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:48.810
Okay.

367 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:57:39.625 --> 00:57:41.335
I'll take a look at that in the script.

368 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:45.000
And I can just send you the script right then.

369 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.330
Yeah, that's fine. Just slip it up.

370 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:52.350
You take zip files or should I put it out on my FTP site and send you a link.

371 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:57.240
Yeah, I think it's usually get blocked. Okay. Okay.

372 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:19.260
It's probably because we don't have a a ship to address.

373 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:26.790
You can go edit copy address I think.

374 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:32.670
No function sherry.

375 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:45.270
There you go. Oh.

376 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:52.590
Oh, you have you have that on street address 2 instead of street address 1.

377 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
00:58:52.590 --> 00:59:00.780
That's why we're getting the error when I tried to put it on 1.

378 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:16.380
See, it looked at the city and state it didn't care, but it's still going to give us that air on the ship to.

379 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:33.390
Yep, they're already out there. I'll look at that and see.

380 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.475
Figure out all the different things you did,

381 "Richard Bentley" (3047046400)
01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.785
you had to slow the recorder when you're watching.

382 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:21.360
Okay.

383 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:38.970
There's no sole address, so you can, you can say.

384 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:44.760
Check the address, and it's only going to track the ship to address cause it doesn't have anything and that's the other one's all blank.

385 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:48.030
It's just going to ignore it. Oh, but it's not like.

386 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:51.270
The 1 is the account, we just did.

387 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:27.720
The update, it's not working, but change roads to road.

388 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:35.280
Well, I found it, right? No, I know, but if we oh, wait.

389 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.750
But it will and then update Yep.

390 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:09.660
I wonder are these backwards maybe this.

391 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:21.780
Is return data through.

392 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:26.940
Oh, the state oh, state USA.

393 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.150
I was wondering if this is mm. Hmm. Uh.

394 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:53.550
I guess I need to comment that 1 out just put a single quote in front of it.

395 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:58.860
Uh, shouldn't be 1 1, right?

396 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:05.820
Yeah, but they didn't do it that way. They just haven't dress and then they have address 2 and then they have address 3 is stupid.

397 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:19.860
Oh, wait, hold on.

398 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:40.830
Let me double check that 1 and then I'll, I'll do it. Let's put the AP 1 in because once we have a meant, it's gonna be easy to to change them.

399 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:51.780
So, other than some things not working, is it what you were expecting?

400 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:03:54.450 --> 01:04:02.400
Um, well, we definitely want to make sure we're updating the address type field.

401 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:07.110
Um, with the commercial residential, um.

402 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:11.220
So, we need to be sure to get that at it, but I guess I was expecting more.

403 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:20.070
Force, you know, I can't exit the order.

404 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:24.330
Unless I have validated all the, it address.

405 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:32.310
Cause it was optional they're not going to do. I mean, that's just the back to life is you can tell them to.

406 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:45.840
Ask them to, but I don't know if we can put a check when you end order or save a customer that.

407 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:53.550
If it's there. Okay, I, I understand what you're saying. I put a note for that.

408 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:05.280
I guess we'd be checking to see is the address in the valid address list and if not. Yeah.

409 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:12.390
Tell them. Hey, yeah, I have to I just have to figure out that macro.

410 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:17.970
Hmm.

411 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:54.150
Did I miss 1? That's when it goes there.

412 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:59.760
I think I missed the script, though. It was all in 1.

413 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.245
I just want the top part, right? Yup.

414 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:06:16.465 --> 01:06:21.025
And see, here, they're different too. Instead of address 1. it says address line 1.

415 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:25.320
Instead of ship address, it says at.

416 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:30.900
It's different people programmed.

417 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:58.650
Oh, wait, you got something there. Why didn't have that? That doesn't make much sense.

418 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:08.400
It's like my is just testing something. Um, we have to have the refresh is to refresh up above.

419 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.090
Yeah.

420 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:16.860
This is all for this 1. uh, so I put the wrong thing in the.

421 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:07:17.215 --> 01:07:18.265
Yeah, that's okay.

422 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:07:18.295 --> 01:07:19.375
I'll give you the right 1

423 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:07:35.305 --> 01:07:39.475
so it would check it. It just won't it won't update it. Okay.

424 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:48.150
Okay, thanks. Oh, we still got those message.

425 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:10.260
I don't think there's, I suppose contact management. Do you have that module?

426 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:17.790
No, okay. Cause if we did, we could add it to that too. I mean.

427 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:32.370
You know what we're doing here don't you.

428 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:40.470
We're playing, you break the system.

429 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:08:53.070 --> 01:09:01.890
Yeah, there were no address, but we do have that in the database. We'll have to clean that 1 out of the date. We are links in the database.

430 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:15.930
So, there's no reason to update this 1.

431 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:19.380
Oh, no, yeah, you could because the state is different, isn't it? Yeah.

432 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.170
Well, that's where you could update it's not going to work on this 1. right? I don't know.

433 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:31.830
Because I had the wrong script, or we didn't have the oh, we didn't have the script. Yes. You're right. Okay.

434 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:09:31.830 --> 01:09:35.130
Um.

435 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:45.180
So, obviously we have a few tweaks and.

436 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:48.570
Then we can try and forcing our go to address.

437 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:09:48.570 --> 01:09:55.740
I don't know if we had that in the original thing or not, but.

438 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:09:55.740 --> 01:10:02.250
I'll take a look and see, it's a, it's a good feature to have.

439 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:06.780
Oh, yes, if I was doing this.

440 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:20.700
You can actually delete all of them if you want, you have to do the edit or change. Yeah you have to do the edit. Yeah.

441 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:28.890
I was just gonna wait so we have the blank address. That's where it's saying that blank is valid.

442 "Richard Bentley" (3047046400)
01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:42.780
It's the, the same may pay 1 would go on the purchase order too, or.

443 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:48.630
Purchase over Ooh, I didn't do purchase order entry. We could add it to that.

444 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:53.850
I mean, if you think about it, Ben, you could probably add it to that all by yourself.

445 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:59.370
Yeah, you just have to pick those right fields up. That's how I kind of wanted to design it that.

446 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:04.770
If there was ever any other place you wanted it, um, do you guys do drop ships?

447 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:14.730
Yeah, so you would have to make a PO that has the ship address being.

448 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:18.300
Where the order was, right? Yeah.

449 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:23.340
Okay, so yes, this would make sense to have in the purchasing in the field.

450 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:27.660
You didn't think of.

451 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:40.830
Give me a couple of days. Uh, okay.

452 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:47.970
Maybe like Monday next week, do it um.

453 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:54.300
Are you providing people? Do you have any questions? Do you have any.

454 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:11:56.190 --> 01:12:08.130
Questions or anything about this our minds can't. Thank you as fast as being tabs. Okay. I was paying attention, but, um.

455 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:15.270
I don't really have any questions just kind of walking through. It doesn't really look a lot of user friendly.

456 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:18.540
On the validation piece, but, um.

457 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:24.450
I guess I was once we get it to run without the train debugging and stuff, maybe.

458 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:12:24.450 --> 01:12:27.900
Okay, yeah, and I think that.

459 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:33.180
What would you if you look at it? It's kinda like, what would you change.

460 "Richard Bentley" (3047046400)
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:42.330
No, I don't know that, you know it now, but, yeah, I mean, I guess I wasn't expecting a custom form. I was just thinking that 1.

461 "Richard Bentley" (3047046400)
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:46.140
Be on that fit, you know, on the field where.

462 "Richard Bentley" (3047046400)
01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:50.370
When they go to, you know, enter the dress.

463 "Richard Bentley" (3047046400)
01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:55.650
I don't know, I just wouldn't think it would be a custom form like that.

464 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:12:58.110 --> 01:13:06.540
But, yeah, I know the piece I know being you mentioned well, if there's no address.

465 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:10.170
You say, well, we're going to force them to do something.

466 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:13.410
So, if they blink out the address.

467 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:17.250
Is it required I mean, they update it because.

468 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:23.010
If the address is invalid, it can't validate it. Then it says it's got to.

469 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:26.460
Blank, so you're still kind of going to be.

470 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:30.510
In the same situation, where you don't have a valid address.

471 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:35.790
And that's the 1 thing that that would be how it would be hard to force validation because.

472 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:40.080
If it's 1 of those cases where there is no address yet.

473 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:45.720
And it's still it's still valid. We want that to go through.

474 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:54.180
Maybe we could just put air messages out and make it so painful for them that they'll do it.

475 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:57.720
And then they only have to go through the painful stuff. If the address.

476 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:05.070
On those few cases, why don't you think about that and see what you want to handle that?

477 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:12.600
All right.

478 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:17.460
We'll play around with this and think through it. Yeah.

479 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:26.310
And just 1 more thing sure. On the so how we found out about the, you know, the the code and the token.

480 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:31.740
Mm, hmm like, how often it changed because I know typically like, where is that store?

481 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:36.690
There's a button on the screen that says to enter it.

482 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:14:36.690 --> 01:14:47.280
Until the license information, so if you click that button, a screen comes up, it shows what your old license information was, and it has 2 places you can type it in and then save it.

483 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:58.080
Well, when I send the license, I guess I'm when I think of 2 or code and the token that is the access to the API, which typically.

484 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:09.240
That changes often when you're running in a company's API. So, is that stored within the code that is passing in that token?

485 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.510
It's starting in the database. Okay.

486 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:19.500
Because just heard the reason you said that if it changes a lot, then.

487 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:25.110
I don't want it hard coding it in the program didn't make sense. And also.

488 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:30.540
Having it yeah. Difficult for you guys to key in didn't make sense either. So we just put it in.

489 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:37.890
Just put it there and, uh, yeah, table test if it's bad, it's gonna give you some goofy error message.

490 "Cather Cheese" (2382460672)
01:15:37.890 --> 01:15:41.610
Yeah, yeah, uh, okay.

491 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:52.140
Yeah, it's definitely mentioned anywhere that it expires. So I'll ask them and say.

492 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:15:52.675 --> 01:16:05.905
Okay, yeah, I'll do the trapping the errors for the street address 1 in the zip code make sure that those 2 things are in there in the right place and if they're not all pop up box up and say, hey,

493 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:16:05.905 --> 01:16:09.505
you need to fix this and I won't even call Smarty cause it'll just give us an error.

494 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:30.960
It's interesting. All right what else do we have for today?

495 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:35.880
That's it. That's fine. That's great.

496 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:44.880
Once we have it a little bit more though, right? I don't know. Do you think you need a user manual for this?

497 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:16:48.450 --> 01:16:52.560
Um, I think we can write something up. Yeah, it's not that.

498 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:16:52.560 --> 01:17:04.410
It's not that big a deal. I'll send you a note on the.

499 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:10.020
So, we got a custom form field for address type.

500 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:16.050
Mm, hmm um, on sales orders and.

501 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.790
Mm, hmm. So is it just sales orders.

502 "Richard Bentley" (3047046400)
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:27.150
It's just sales force isn't it should be yeah.

503 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:17:31.290 --> 01:17:35.850
Or on the customer, I think we've got for the, um.

504 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:17:40.710 --> 01:17:45.360
Shipping address, um, let me double check. It's, uh.

505 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:54.660
Yeah, right you pass that when you do it you pass that field too. Smarty.

506 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:59.730
So, it knows it's a personal address versus a.

507 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:03.180
Commercial address, or does it come back.

508 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:12.660
And tell you what it is, it comes back and tells you. Okay. I got it. I just have to look and see where that is. Yeah, if you send me a note and say what the form custom form fields are.

509 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:18.330
Then I'll take a look at their.

510 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:18:18.330 --> 01:18:32.460
Residential, that was the word I was talking, they call it the residential indicator.

511 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:41.760
Yeah, you wouldn't have a custom form pill for that under the, uh.

512 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:48.120
Supplier now we just have it on sales orders and customers.

513 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:51.630
Yeah, is it.

514 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:57.600
Is the custom form field on the screen so I can grab it through.

515 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.600
Because I don't do any saving directly to the.

516 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:08.430
Database or anything, except for my stuff, I put it on the screen so that you can save it if you want to or you can abandon whatever.

517 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:12.000
Using streets.

518 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:20.340
So, we're going to want that on the screen, and I just need to know where it is.

519 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:26.160
Yeah, so it is.

520 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:35.100
Right here can you send me a screen print of that? 1 quick? Yeah.

521 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:47.130
Is all I need to know really is address type that that's the name of it and that that is that the name name on the sales order? Yep. Okay.

522 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:06.960
I think, uh, I think Smarty just returns it as is a residential yes. Or no. So we would do.

523 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.580
Residential or commercial.

524 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:20.460
Okay, yeah, send me that 1, too, because I need to know that too that that's what's.

525 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:35.520
So, when you pick up, when you pick 1, it, it shows the whole word end to address type, right? Yeah.

526 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.940
Yep. Okay.

527 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:51.630
I suppose they have to spell it, right? Okay.

528 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:20:52.860 --> 01:21:01.890
Did you guys think of anything? Um, we've got my email if you don't it's Terry dot more at Cisco dot com.

529 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:07.380
To shoot me a note, if you have any suggestions or anything else, because.

530 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:11.040
Okay, requiring leads 1 at all.

531 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:18.150
You see the button for configure license.

532 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:21:18.150 --> 01:21:24.270
Down there. Mm. Hmm. That's where you would put the the, um.

533 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:21:26.010 --> 01:21:30.660
The ID in the token, okay when it changes.

534 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:21:32.010 --> 01:21:37.320
And after you put it in, you would want to verify it to make sure that it's good.

535 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:43.950
And it will come back and say it's good or it'll give you an error and then you would say that you don't want to save the blanks right now.

536 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:50.790
Okay, I can generate generate a new 1 and give it a try.

537 "Richard Bentley" (3047046400)
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:59.220
Mm, hmm. Yeah, I was thinking we probably want to have that from the users or something. Yeah.

538 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:23.700
Then you would just save it, not save it to the database.

539 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:27.990
Oh, you changed.

540 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:37.320
Now, if you went to the database and look, actually, if you just did it again, it would show you the new ones you had entered in.

541 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:56.220
Hmm.

542 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:04.800
It's not the 1 I entered in.

543 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:14.310
It's not either 1 that what's in? What's in the database? That would be my question.

544 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:17.550
Maybe it's not maybe it didn't save it. Right?

545 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:35.820
Oh, that's the 1. your head, right? Oh, I got checked. I made a put a hard code in there instead of the other.

546 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:42.120
Yeah.

547 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:51.060
But it saved it correctly. That's that's yeah.

548 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:23:56.010 --> 01:23:59.610
2 things to do, not too bad.

549 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:23:59.610 --> 01:24:04.050
You hit it harder than I, you did a lot of things that I didn't even think about doing.

550 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:12.300
Good start, which is good. That's that's what we do. I mean, that's why we.

551 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:18.120
Why we do this.

552 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:21.870
Thank you for your time I really appreciate it and, uh.

553 "Ben Erickson" (1838977280)
01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:30.390
Work out well, I just sent you those screenshots. Okay great.

554 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:36.330
All right have a good day. Alrighty yeah.

555 "Terry Moore" (2155789824)
01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:40.020
Talk to you later. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
