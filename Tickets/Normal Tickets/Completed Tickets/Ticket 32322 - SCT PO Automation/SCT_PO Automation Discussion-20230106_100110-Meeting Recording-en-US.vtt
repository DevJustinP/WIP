638d722e-5670-4632-a76c-89db53a0ca3b-0
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.406
Alrighty, um. So just to
overview, uh, this meeting is

638d722e-5670-4632-a76c-89db53a0ca3b-1
00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:12.070
just to go over.

3dc471bf-963a-4e51-88d2-b9f659af45f9-0
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.520
The requirements for the SCT and
PO Automation uh project. Some

3dc471bf-963a-4e51-88d2-b9f659af45f9-1
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.280
things that I would like to get
out of this is just to confirm.

5b18e61f-fc96-4d1f-bb1a-91bb267f6c1a-0
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.536
Current state of how things are
being processed and then make

5b18e61f-fc96-4d1f-bb1a-91bb267f6c1a-1
00:00:30.536 --> 00:00:33.330
sure the future state has been.

11bca17d-b1b0-4fcd-8d48-4af7ff905b56-0
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.148
Uh, solidified. And then if we
need to have further

11bca17d-b1b0-4fcd-8d48-4af7ff905b56-1
00:00:39.148 --> 00:00:41.400
discussions, we can. Um.

08572815-5dc1-4a51-b90a-afafb7546dd4-0
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.120
You know, analyze that and
schedule those as needed.

f20eb125-01bc-4712-97da-85e0eb9713e1-0
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.380
Um.

155d6a93-c0aa-4eec-a757-e012b9f8893b-0
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.034
So the overall agenda with SCT
PO automation from I I

155d6a93-c0aa-4eec-a757-e012b9f8893b-1
00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:58.510
understand is that retail orders
come in.

24893a57-c532-427f-bfed-81a0cd03185e-0
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.143
Or those line items are in a
backordered status and with

24893a57-c532-427f-bfed-81a0cd03185e-1
00:01:04.143 --> 00:01:07.480
those they go through a back
order review.

3325bbf7-ed9f-44ab-8cd8-088d7453b2d2-0
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.136
A SCT or PO's created based off
what is needed and that is more

3325bbf7-ed9f-44ab-8cd8-088d7453b2d2-1
00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:20.156
or less a manual process and we
want to automate that as much as

3325bbf7-ed9f-44ab-8cd8-088d7453b2d2-2
00:01:20.156 --> 00:01:25.620
we can so that less people are
having to do that manually.

0f49adc9-8318-4119-9e93-d90967bc7a7f-0
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.480
Is everyone good with that
general outline?

85bb83f9-2414-43a1-9325-d69ee3489698-0
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.070
Yes, yes, Sir. Music to my ears.
Awesome. Great.

a142625c-9c50-4657-a338-043aae4a98e1-0
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.759
So future state is we're going
to have an automated uh service

a142625c-9c50-4657-a338-043aae4a98e1-1
00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.746
that would be able to look at
retail orders that come in and

a142625c-9c50-4657-a338-043aae4a98e1-2
00:01:46.746 --> 00:01:51.978
as long as they're in a certain
status, which that is something

a142625c-9c50-4657-a338-043aae4a98e1-3
00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:53.940
we also need to lay out.

d57bab69-9db2-4a13-a300-606617f6d78a-0
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.610
The process will pick up the
order. Understand.

4840f379-a3a8-458b-8254-9c555586a67c-0
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.240
What the item needs, whether
it's an set to get that item to

4840f379-a3a8-458b-8254-9c555586a67c-1
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.680
the store or a purchase order to
get them ordered.

02bd59e6-6069-4014-a6cf-d22978ac7192-0
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.970
And we'll go from there.

eff86b4f-f40a-42f4-b076-576581988de0-0
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.297
Sound good? Yep. Awesome. So
something I need to know is just

eff86b4f-f40a-42f4-b076-576581988de0-1
00:02:20.297 --> 00:02:24.050
walk through some of the details
on.

f5486beb-805f-48bf-880a-2def30d33eaa-0
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.549
What these retail orders look
like before the review, the

f5486beb-805f-48bf-880a-2def30d33eaa-1
00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.256
review process can start and
then during the review process

f5486beb-805f-48bf-880a-2def30d33eaa-2
00:02:34.256 --> 00:02:37.080
when looking at item, what
denotes?

5e416997-4abd-488d-ac52-c05d0663979f-0
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.030
What to happen?

e4a1e38f-de70-4399-846f-88aa1a3f5f11-0
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.630
So um.

75645df4-fcec-411b-a12e-30318638f7d5-0
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.363
And just thinking through what's
going to be needed. Um, I think

75645df4-fcec-411b-a12e-30318638f7d5-1
00:02:48.363 --> 00:02:52.681
the biggest thing is, and I know
Ben has a ticket in with Ecat to

75645df4-fcec-411b-a12e-30318638f7d5-2
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:53.140
select.

06d28b4d-d731-4701-a8d8-5bf57b43055e-0
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.565
Line item, you know what is sold
off the floor and what needs to

06d28b4d-d731-4701-a8d8-5bf57b43055e-1
00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:02.831
be ordered from you know the
warehouse or third party vendor

06d28b4d-d731-4701-a8d8-5bf57b43055e-2
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:07.166
or whatever. So I think that
would be the, the, the obviously

06d28b4d-d731-4701-a8d8-5bf57b43055e-3
00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:11.502
the first trigger. The second
thing that I see as a potential

06d28b4d-d731-4701-a8d8-5bf57b43055e-4
00:03:11.502 --> 00:03:15.768
roadblock issue is going to be
SKUs that are not created. So

06d28b4d-d731-4701-a8d8-5bf57b43055e-5
00:03:15.768 --> 00:03:19.964
there's a lot of custom third
party products right now that

06d28b4d-d731-4701-a8d8-5bf57b43055e-6
00:03:19.964 --> 00:03:24.090
you know a customer can you know
buy like a fire tainment.

a94f7aee-0014-4ed3-967e-e6b7ec45eb80-0
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.920
Fire pit where they can, you
know, select, you know certain

a94f7aee-0014-4ed3-967e-e6b7ec45eb80-1
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.805
size, a certain color and that
skew is not in our system when

a94f7aee-0014-4ed3-967e-e6b7ec45eb80-2
00:03:31.805 --> 00:03:35.878
the order is placed. We have to
on the back end create that skew

a94f7aee-0014-4ed3-967e-e6b7ec45eb80-3
00:03:35.878 --> 00:03:39.763
after the order is inputted.
Same thing for Tucci or treasure

a94f7aee-0014-4ed3-967e-e6b7ec45eb80-4
00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:43.774
card. Now some of the SKUs are
already have been ordered so you

a94f7aee-0014-4ed3-967e-e6b7ec45eb80-5
00:03:43.774 --> 00:03:47.471
know there are some that you
know they will select and you

a94f7aee-0014-4ed3-967e-e6b7ec45eb80-6
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:51.294
know could be pushed through.
And then the other thing is to

a94f7aee-0014-4ed3-967e-e6b7ec45eb80-7
00:03:51.294 --> 00:03:54.239
denote I think, I guess it would
be solved by.

ce820a1c-686a-453f-9d1f-f2d3f86ca86f-0
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.439
You know, sold off the floor or
not. But if we're talking about

ce820a1c-686a-453f-9d1f-f2d3f86ca86f-1
00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:02.146
automating Ppos is like on
accessories, like when we sell

ce820a1c-686a-453f-9d1f-f2d3f86ca86f-2
00:04:02.146 --> 00:04:04.830
it off, if we're taking it off
the floor.

ef717478-c4be-4521-8aa7-2f06f7e4e242-0
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.182
Are we talking about automating
like if it goes below a certain

ef717478-c4be-4521-8aa7-2f06f7e4e242-1
00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:14.265
threshold that you know, orders
are entered like can we select,

ef717478-c4be-4521-8aa7-2f06f7e4e242-2
00:04:14.265 --> 00:04:18.411
can we go down to the SKU level
and say, OK, we want this set of

ef717478-c4be-4521-8aa7-2f06f7e4e242-3
00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:22.494
SKUs to always be in stock and
if it goes below this threshold,

ef717478-c4be-4521-8aa7-2f06f7e4e242-4
00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:26.577
you know, a PO is generated or
something like or it looks at it

ef717478-c4be-4521-8aa7-2f06f7e4e242-5
00:04:26.577 --> 00:04:30.277
on a, you know, monthly or
quarterly basis. So let me try

ef717478-c4be-4521-8aa7-2f06f7e4e242-6
00:04:30.277 --> 00:04:34.232
to answer those questions. From
what I understand, Umm, first

ef717478-c4be-4521-8aa7-2f06f7e4e242-7
00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:36.210
one, the SKU not being created.

cabe34c4-796e-4017-8b63-6cb2c1b22318-0
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.838
Uh, we uh. The way I understand
the SCT to be created, we'll be

cabe34c4-796e-4017-8b63-6cb2c1b22318-1
00:04:41.838 --> 00:04:46.822
looking at the invoice INV
warehouse record for that item

cabe34c4-796e-4017-8b63-6cb2c1b22318-2
00:04:46.822 --> 00:04:52.063
from that store to know where
what warehouse to receive that

cabe34c4-796e-4017-8b63-6cb2c1b22318-3
00:04:52.063 --> 00:04:57.648
item from. And in the case that
the SKU isn't created yet, there

cabe34c4-796e-4017-8b63-6cb2c1b22318-4
00:04:57.648 --> 00:05:03.233
shouldn't be any kind of records
for those items. So skewed from

cabe34c4-796e-4017-8b63-6cb2c1b22318-5
00:05:03.233 --> 00:05:06.670
what I understand skews that are
being.

bac78867-0389-4ab4-b4ad-bea62d3592c0-0
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.340
Created on the order.

54808340-ecdb-4c6a-b2be-fcf257a2b414-0
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.194
Will not be able to go through
the automation. They'll have to

54808340-ecdb-4c6a-b2be-fcf257a2b414-1
00:05:15.194 --> 00:05:20.399
either be go through the manual
process or whatever is already

54808340-ecdb-4c6a-b2be-fcf257a2b414-2
00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:25.191
being done to fulfill those
items, or the automation will

54808340-ecdb-4c6a-b2be-fcf257a2b414-3
00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:27.670
not pick those items up until.

22633bdd-44bb-44cb-8a3e-667f2b4f756d-0
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.530
Everything has been set up for
those newly created SKUs.

62fa03b2-3542-4c2a-9b8b-36ac15f224a7-0
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.170
Does that.

693f05b3-75cc-40bc-99fc-dbc1a91f9e4d-0
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.885
Follow for everyone and would
that mean for the whole order

693f05b3-75cc-40bc-99fc-dbc1a91f9e4d-1
00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:42.818
automation wouldn't take place
or does that mean just for this

693f05b3-75cc-40bc-99fc-dbc1a91f9e4d-2
00:05:42.818 --> 00:05:46.189
specific excuse just for the
specific line items, OK.

757c785f-e09a-4c94-ae48-fc86bb95890a-0
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.295
Ohh, could we do the later?
Like, so here's what I I mean,

757c785f-e09a-4c94-ae48-fc86bb95890a-1
00:05:57.295 --> 00:06:01.508
here's a problem I perceive with
that is if an order goes through

757c785f-e09a-4c94-ae48-fc86bb95890a-2
00:06:01.508 --> 00:06:05.402
and automates right? And then
there is one or two skews that

757c785f-e09a-4c94-ae48-fc86bb95890a-3
00:06:05.402 --> 00:06:09.231
can't automate, obviously, you
know, we would either need a

757c785f-e09a-4c94-ae48-fc86bb95890a-4
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:12.806
report or something that
generates so that we know, you

757c785f-e09a-4c94-ae48-fc86bb95890a-5
00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:16.700
know, that that wasn't ordered
or, you know, to catch those.

4280c309-3aa5-49e8-b19a-c2b1b1b9ebd8-0
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.680
Um, but then my fear is that the
store goes back and manually.

7d8c66d0-fa3c-429b-946b-27f46877f566-0
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.854
Orders and everything, you know,
an accident. So is there a case

7d8c66d0-fa3c-429b-946b-27f46877f566-1
00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:32.407
that we could where nothing gets
ordered until because then a for

7d8c66d0-fa3c-429b-946b-27f46877f566-2
00:06:32.407 --> 00:06:36.753
our perspective it puts pressure
on the store to get that skew

7d8c66d0-fa3c-429b-946b-27f46877f566-3
00:06:36.753 --> 00:06:40.961
created and on us to get it
created and obtain timely manner

7d8c66d0-fa3c-429b-946b-27f46877f566-4
00:06:40.961 --> 00:06:44.480
which we have struggles with
right now to do that.

331a5f73-a13d-4d37-a1b9-2b8d10e2b333-0
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.446
That's not, I mean, but then on
the flip side, it's not customer

331a5f73-a13d-4d37-a1b9-2b8d10e2b333-1
00:06:50.446 --> 00:06:54.116
facing, you know, responsible.
So that's probably not the best

331a5f73-a13d-4d37-a1b9-2b8d10e2b333-2
00:06:54.116 --> 00:06:57.319
route to go. I'm, I'm just
speaking out loud here. But

331a5f73-a13d-4d37-a1b9-2b8d10e2b333-3
00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:00.640
yeah, I guess I just, I'm, I'd
be afraid of duplication.

c5699b1d-c996-477e-9117-a6cdb8e3993e-0
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.913
You know if some of it's
automated and some of it's

c5699b1d-c996-477e-9117-a6cdb8e3993e-1
00:07:04.913 --> 00:07:05.280
manual.

29f3fd09-360e-4c37-9189-3598df1caabd-0
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:12.293
So the automation, uh, just to
try to, um, silence your fears a

29f3fd09-360e-4c37-9189-3598df1caabd-1
00:07:12.293 --> 00:07:18.287
little. Um, the automation would
be able to know whether or not

29f3fd09-360e-4c37-9189-3598df1caabd-2
00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:23.719
line items have already been
processed. And so the future

29f3fd09-360e-4c37-9189-3598df1caabd-3
00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:29.806
state in my mind currently would
be that the automation would be

29f3fd09-360e-4c37-9189-3598df1caabd-4
00:07:29.806 --> 00:07:35.800
able to know when the order has
been first created and imported

29f3fd09-360e-4c37-9189-3598df1caabd-5
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.549
in from.

6abbb4dc-773f-4625-9cc5-387d3ed57d35-0
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.340
We can't.

6e588b93-9490-4d3b-8049-50702c7b9699-0
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.120
That trigger say, hey, we need
to review these things. Um.

3b5f9038-36b0-42e7-957c-f797a95abb51-0
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.651
And then after that there will
be also another process to just

3b5f9038-36b0-42e7-957c-f797a95abb51-1
00:07:49.651 --> 00:07:55.015
review current back order items,
maybe on a nightly basis and

3b5f9038-36b0-42e7-957c-f797a95abb51-2
00:07:55.015 --> 00:08:00.380
retrigger reprocess all items
that are in a back order status

3b5f9038-36b0-42e7-957c-f797a95abb51-3
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:05.485
that haven't already been
allocated to an SCT or allocated

3b5f9038-36b0-42e7-957c-f797a95abb51-4
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:10.590
to be acquired from a purchase
order and attempt to try to

3b5f9038-36b0-42e7-957c-f797a95abb51-5
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:15.090
acquire them OK and then in that
automated service.

4f8cf403-53dd-40f7-b714-db2da0e5f6e9-0
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.362
To generate the same set,
meaning like if we leave off

4f8cf403-53dd-40f7-b714-db2da0e5f6e9-1
00:08:19.362 --> 00:08:23.641
one, you know to the main
warehouse and it generates an

4f8cf403-53dd-40f7-b714-db2da0e5f6e9-2
00:08:23.641 --> 00:08:28.073
SCT and then it goes back and
gets another skew, would it

4f8cf403-53dd-40f7-b714-db2da0e5f6e9-3
00:08:28.073 --> 00:08:32.811
generate a new SCT or would it
generate on that same existing

4f8cf403-53dd-40f7-b714-db2da0e5f6e9-4
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:37.625
set that was created. So that's
something we can we'll need to

4f8cf403-53dd-40f7-b714-db2da0e5f6e9-5
00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:41.981
hammer out the details of when
an item can be added to a

4f8cf403-53dd-40f7-b714-db2da0e5f6e9-6
00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:45.420
current Scott for the order or
if a new set.

0efda929-2298-4452-9cc4-fff899424616-0
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.200
Needs to be created. OK,
alright, cool.

fdc21ad9-83eb-45d2-b42b-118d10caf2b5-0
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.920
Um.

3d16bcc4-4899-4a59-912a-6681e622d0af-0
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.624
The reports, uh, that is
definitely something that could

3d16bcc4-4899-4a59-912a-6681e622d0af-1
00:08:58.624 --> 00:09:02.778
be done. Um, again, we just
need. I'll just need to know

3d16bcc4-4899-4a59-912a-6681e622d0af-2
00:09:02.778 --> 00:09:06.860
some of the specific information
that the report could.

fe87d6bf-1898-45d1-8f05-4ee68bce78be-0
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.650
Show so that everyone
understands.

1c63cf0a-0a06-43f0-89e1-32a812264490-0
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.010
What needs to be done and not
just a bunch of gibberish?

d5f6d926-7513-4c5d-a9c6-16d910ebce17-0
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:17.890
Um.

416cc3f9-22a1-4e51-90a4-2d3f792db3b7-0
00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:26.791
You mean I don't have to learn
coding today? Just kidding. No,

416cc3f9-22a1-4e51-90a4-2d3f792db3b7-1
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:27.840
definitely not.

5b1a447b-78f4-427e-88e3-8c27e18e3565-0
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:34.494
Hopefully I can do a good
translation of technical to the

5b1a447b-78f4-427e-88e3-8c27e18e3565-1
00:09:34.494 --> 00:09:36.140
business application.

10578fec-0b0b-40ea-a6bd-b10623d7ee69-0
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.240
And that's why we're having
these meetings, so we can all be

10578fec-0b0b-40ea-a6bd-b10623d7ee69-1
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.090
speaking apples to apples and.

db5c55c1-7d4c-4637-84c3-24be986dbd40-0
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.120
Everything. Um, so.

5550df4e-b12f-46cf-9421-8edbf206773b-0
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.650
OK, um.

fc615617-1538-4052-bede-7f4ccb1de62f-0
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:06.200
Next question, you have uh was
sold off the floor.

0e86ff23-716d-44e7-a37b-f4951882a50e-0
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.278
Would let me first ask the
question to kind of split, uh,

0e86ff23-716d-44e7-a37b-f4951882a50e-1
00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:16.895
that would definitely be
something that the store has

0e86ff23-716d-44e7-a37b-f4951882a50e-2
00:10:16.895 --> 00:10:22.196
designated that it's gonna use
in store quantity to purchase,

0e86ff23-716d-44e7-a37b-f4951882a50e-3
00:10:22.196 --> 00:10:22.879
correct?

4632f8a7-0c57-4088-a1dc-6953eb12f368-0
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.949
Yes. So from what I understand
that new ecap field with uh

4632f8a7-0c57-4088-a1dc-6953eb12f368-1
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:34.320
denote whether or not that item
is going to be using in store.

e2ab3b43-9477-45ca-891c-7bfd5a3b51e7-0
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.750
Quantity to fulfill that item
and.

c8c56c06-756e-49f5-9bb6-0e5e62a72e66-0
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.280
Um.

ed736a4d-4bd6-4abf-b924-3d1e04a18843-0
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.990
That would that would.

30306583-39f3-4b52-8efb-84a5131ca103-0
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:50.598
Denote whether or not to use in
store quantity or not. So you

30306583-39f3-4b52-8efb-84a5131ca103-1
00:10:50.598 --> 00:10:50.990
know.

3d648337-1dac-4ba0-94cb-401031808ccb-0
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.140
No, sorry, go ahead. That's
already um.

ba4e65a7-ec17-46c7-b9b3-39bb47ee3e19-0
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.250
Within.

fb5e82b9-34c4-4fe3-8bca-033bb9ac69aa-0
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:02.526
If it's not specified in this
document, that is definitely

fb5e82b9-34c4-4fe3-8bca-033bb9ac69aa-1
00:11:02.526 --> 00:11:06.159
something that is gonna be used
in this automation. If

fb5e82b9-34c4-4fe3-8bca-033bb9ac69aa-2
00:11:06.159 --> 00:11:10.518
automation looks at a back order
item and looks at the new field,

fb5e82b9-34c4-4fe3-8bca-033bb9ac69aa-3
00:11:10.518 --> 00:11:14.811
it should denote whether or not
it's gonna use in store quantity

fb5e82b9-34c4-4fe3-8bca-033bb9ac69aa-4
00:11:14.811 --> 00:11:18.510
or it needs to be special
ordered. And if it's gonna be

fb5e82b9-34c4-4fe3-8bca-033bb9ac69aa-5
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.406
special ordered, that's when
it's going to start trying to

fb5e82b9-34c4-4fe3-8bca-033bb9ac69aa-6
00:11:22.406 --> 00:11:23.859
process OK, set or PO.

b5df2773-27b1-43ff-a70a-682cbe84b560-0
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.211
And go there. Yeah, the question
of and Sean might have the same

b5df2773-27b1-43ff-a70a-682cbe84b560-1
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:34.624
question. So currently our
inventory is just one big

b5df2773-27b1-43ff-a70a-682cbe84b560-2
00:11:34.624 --> 00:11:39.203
massive bucket. So it's store
inventory which could be

b5df2773-27b1-43ff-a70a-682cbe84b560-3
00:11:39.203 --> 00:11:44.115
display, it could be back of
house inventory, which is the

b5df2773-27b1-43ff-a70a-682cbe84b560-4
00:11:44.115 --> 00:11:49.110
overflow that we could sell
through or it could be customer

b5df2773-27b1-43ff-a70a-682cbe84b560-5
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.610
order.

0ac395ec-5b2e-4b84-8ca1-3dbc5bbf0ffd-0
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.255
If it's in the shipped column, I
guess I'm talking myself out of

0ac395ec-5b2e-4b84-8ca1-3dbc5bbf0ffd-1
00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:57.382
that one. So how do they denote
the difference between? Or how

0ac395ec-5b2e-4b84-8ca1-3dbc5bbf0ffd-2
00:11:57.382 --> 00:12:00.309
would we write the logic to
denote the difference between?

db25231e-6177-4e83-a111-2e96ca460fe5-0
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:06.020
Would we have like a threshold
built into that? Like if the

db25231e-6177-4e83-a111-2e96ca460fe5-1
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:10.591
item is one or less than it
would go through the automation

db25231e-6177-4e83-a111-2e96ca460fe5-2
00:12:10.591 --> 00:12:15.086
piece of it or two or less? Or
how would we need to delete

db25231e-6177-4e83-a111-2e96ca460fe5-3
00:12:15.086 --> 00:12:19.809
something from what? So this is
just information I'm relaying

db25231e-6177-4e83-a111-2e96ca460fe5-4
00:12:19.809 --> 00:12:21.790
from what Ben has told me.

5b562d72-8045-4e7d-b28d-23fc17c0fd7e-0
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:28.817
The ecat field. The person
entering the order would need to

5b562d72-8045-4e7d-b28d-23fc17c0fd7e-1
00:12:28.817 --> 00:12:34.507
know whether or not the store
could fulfill the item. So that

5b562d72-8045-4e7d-b28d-23fc17c0fd7e-2
00:12:34.507 --> 00:12:38.730
field would come over and it
would be marked.

e87aa98a-5038-4dea-b55e-e131eefdbb12-0
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.396
Based off of that, and the
automation isn't gonna do

e87aa98a-5038-4dea-b55e-e131eefdbb12-1
00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:45.902
anything else, it's gonna look
at that. If it says it's using

e87aa98a-5038-4dea-b55e-e131eefdbb12-2
00:12:45.902 --> 00:12:48.390
in store quantity, it's not
gonna touch it.

33717ce2-6ac8-4f63-9dc7-e2d1bd3bccbf-0
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.180
OK, continue.

4e2aac2e-395d-4b09-a509-daf5def38243-0
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.510
Um.

e0ebe13f-c3cb-4dd2-a6b5-d6ec6dd7f62e-0
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:54.580
Does that.

4f8e3692-3a2b-4908-8afb-7cb0900b2e16-0
00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:01.479
Is this something that you want
to flesh out a little more or is

4f8e3692-3a2b-4908-8afb-7cb0900b2e16-1
00:13:01.479 --> 00:13:03.130
does that satisfy?

47b26a72-a934-46f1-a7b5-3a8324c0d0e9-0
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.200
Your requirements.

5c7a559e-2049-4eb6-b2f3-22ac6ecd5cc3-0
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.140
Um, I mean I.

7968ed22-dd1d-4674-a37d-83f01f6a40b2-0
00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:17.759
Yeah, I guess it would fit. I
mean my question was going to be

7968ed22-dd1d-4674-a37d-83f01f6a40b2-1
00:13:17.759 --> 00:13:17.970
if.

c1089af8-05d4-43ae-b3f3-16abb88f23dc-0
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.726
Like I'm assuming if if the
design consultant or whoever's

c1089af8-05d4-43ae-b3f3-16abb88f23dc-1
00:13:24.726 --> 00:13:28.550
placing the order so selects
this is in store stock.

e1c34f66-abd8-491e-87bd-39284e08f015-0
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.689
It's not going to generate the
back order review, but then if

e1c34f66-abd8-491e-87bd-39284e08f015-1
00:13:32.689 --> 00:13:35.597
the order goes in and there's
not the correct amount of

e1c34f66-abd8-491e-87bd-39284e08f015-2
00:13:35.597 --> 00:13:36.480
inventory for it.

e29632f7-9777-4a55-9128-438320a9fdca-0
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:41.541
Then the item is going to be in
the back order when it blows

e29632f7-9777-4a55-9128-438320a9fdca-1
00:13:41.541 --> 00:13:42.350
into syspro.

dbc16a2b-c7fb-45e6-84ec-807b97e48a4a-0
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.669
So will that still get STD or is
there going to be a? I'm

dbc16a2b-c7fb-45e6-84ec-807b97e48a4a-1
00:13:46.669 --> 00:13:50.630
assuming there be a trigger no
matter what is selected, as long

dbc16a2b-c7fb-45e6-84ec-807b97e48a4a-2
00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.653
as it's selected in store stock,
whether it's in the ship column

dbc16a2b-c7fb-45e6-84ec-807b97e48a4a-3
00:13:54.653 --> 00:13:58.366
or not, it's not going to get
automated to an SCT, correct?

dbc16a2b-c7fb-45e6-84ec-807b97e48a4a-4
00:13:58.366 --> 00:14:02.327
Yeah. Then I think, yeah. So the
automation is going to look at

dbc16a2b-c7fb-45e6-84ec-807b97e48a4a-5
00:14:02.327 --> 00:14:05.546
that field, if it has been
selected to use in store

dbc16a2b-c7fb-45e6-84ec-807b97e48a4a-6
00:14:05.546 --> 00:14:09.321
quantity, it's not gonna do
anything with it. It's gonna sit

dbc16a2b-c7fb-45e6-84ec-807b97e48a4a-7
00:14:09.321 --> 00:14:11.239
there in the back order status.

3857aaf3-a007-41d9-99d7-3169007edde0-0
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:13.060
OK.

31fa943f-6669-47cb-adf3-8aaaf9754276-0
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:19.069
And then so we do use like fill
in ski or SC1 SKU for those

31fa943f-6669-47cb-adf3-8aaaf9754276-1
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:23.174
products that are like they
haven't been the SKUs that

31fa943f-6669-47cb-adf3-8aaaf9754276-2
00:14:23.174 --> 00:14:27.430
haven't been created for
vendors, so if that's selected.

0f7733cf-ea80-43d9-8ef3-f7cff999c9fc-0
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:29.290
Umm.

184958e2-8a05-4c5f-8500-175ca5ead7c6-0
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:35.550
Obviously that can't be ordered
because it's a non stocked skew.

07ccb041-feb8-4c7d-9ce6-864684fd82f2-0
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.912
And they select obviously, I
mean I guess we would just have

07ccb041-feb8-4c7d-9ce6-864684fd82f2-1
00:14:41.912 --> 00:14:46.290
to figure out what that what the
process needs to be for those.

6ad2da20-6fc4-4118-a72f-942e03dab9f5-0
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:47.890
Correct.

28faba95-45ef-473a-a31d-e4744ad038ca-0
00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:50.820
Yeah.

20cc4926-c897-4880-a30d-a4e641a32aac-0
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:57.527
So uh, let. Let's flesh out that
a little bit. If an item was to

20cc4926-c897-4880-a30d-a4e641a32aac-1
00:14:57.527 --> 00:15:01.490
come in back, order status newly
created SKU um.

d6ae9a3e-e181-47f7-83f4-b00344c94957-0
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:06.835
Now I I would need to do a
little bit more research to make

d6ae9a3e-e181-47f7-83f4-b00344c94957-1
00:15:06.835 --> 00:15:11.445
sure I understand this. This is
what would happen, but there

d6ae9a3e-e181-47f7-83f4-b00344c94957-2
00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:15.754
shouldn't be any kind of
warehouse record for that skew.

d6ae9a3e-e181-47f7-83f4-b00344c94957-3
00:15:15.754 --> 00:15:20.138
So the automation wouldn't be
able to create an SAT or PO

d6ae9a3e-e181-47f7-83f4-b00344c94957-4
00:15:20.138 --> 00:15:24.446
because it doesn't know it
doesn't have records for that

d6ae9a3e-e181-47f7-83f4-b00344c94957-5
00:15:24.446 --> 00:15:26.789
and that case that is going to.

04b3390b-a817-4eb0-927e-139ff2f3bc28-0
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:29.170
Could it could be?

5fb969a4-7347-4f29-99ab-084214e577b1-0
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.950
Created within a report.

fd224d37-159c-4927-968d-baeed21664ce-0
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:37.070
To send out and say hey this is
a newly created SKU in the back

fd224d37-159c-4927-968d-baeed21664ce-1
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:41.294
order on this order. This will
be within the back order review

fd224d37-159c-4927-968d-baeed21664ce-2
00:15:41.294 --> 00:15:43.440
process or needs to be manually.

c8315e37-8097-4e92-9c26-a26ecc9e6cbf-0
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:44.720
Entered.

6c1de4c4-2c3b-4995-8d5f-4caad965e49e-0
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.804
Can you repeat that one more
time? I'm sorry, I didn't

6c1de4c4-2c3b-4995-8d5f-4caad965e49e-1
00:15:55.804 --> 00:15:57.090
follow. I apologize. OK.

38369496-7b54-4f10-bcb8-0d928d007855-0
00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:03.881
Syspro receives a retail order.
Hmm. Uh, the items. There are

38369496-7b54-4f10-bcb8-0d928d007855-1
00:16:03.881 --> 00:16:05.550
items in back order.

d1cfd847-2c6c-467a-abcb-2f2cfd24bc03-0
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.981
Say one or several items on that
specific order have been newly

d1cfd847-2c6c-467a-abcb-2f2cfd24bc03-1
00:16:12.981 --> 00:16:14.020
created, so.

38d2468c-eba8-4ddf-aab3-d83c6af5db8e-0
00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:21.308
In my understanding of how
Syspro worked, there shouldn't

38d2468c-eba8-4ddf-aab3-d83c6af5db8e-1
00:16:21.308 --> 00:16:27.441
be any record of that stock code
within our inventory, so the

38d2468c-eba8-4ddf-aab3-d83c6af5db8e-2
00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:28.530
automation.

da84ae59-6d63-49e7-8344-0fc13bbf8755-0
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:35.336
Wouldn't be able to mark it as
an SCT and continue creating

da84ae59-6d63-49e7-8344-0fc13bbf8755-1
00:16:35.336 --> 00:16:36.810
that script or?

a02d6dd5-3e73-43a5-a484-b76730d541d9-0
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:42.748
Create the purchase order
because we know we need to order

a02d6dd5-3e73-43a5-a484-b76730d541d9-1
00:16:42.748 --> 00:16:47.996
it from a vendor because it
knows it can't do any of those

a02d6dd5-3e73-43a5-a484-b76730d541d9-2
00:16:47.996 --> 00:16:53.599
two. We can put it on a report
to be sent out and say hey this

a02d6dd5-3e73-43a5-a484-b76730d541d9-3
00:16:53.599 --> 00:16:58.936
order contain this line item
that could not create a script

a02d6dd5-3e73-43a5-a484-b76730d541d9-4
00:16:58.936 --> 00:17:02.049
or purchase order for and
further.

8a320100-52c9-4a5c-8335-35495ed87786-0
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.410
Action is required to process
this.

ed4e9bfd-4100-4c02-a3b4-7ba670ac2c1f-0
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.026
Is there what would be your
recommendation though to get it

ed4e9bfd-4100-4c02-a3b4-7ba670ac2c1f-1
00:17:12.026 --> 00:17:16.275
off that report? Meaning like
we've done some action therefore

ed4e9bfd-4100-4c02-a3b4-7ba670ac2c1f-2
00:17:16.275 --> 00:17:17.490
it's removed like.

7b68d97d-464b-4a3a-a0f1-bf0b30123233-0
00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.200
So.

e55f423b-f452-4268-8798-ed6084c11306-0
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.730
Something that could happen in.

3059c4f6-6a97-49ba-83a2-f8c6e5145e96-0
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:27.840
Correct me if this won't work
for the business, but um.

95aced32-9f2c-4e2e-b78d-e48c15dc525c-0
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:34.739
This automation will also run at
a certain point to just process

95aced32-9f2c-4e2e-b78d-e48c15dc525c-1
00:17:34.739 --> 00:17:39.985
back order items and if it
attempts to reprocess this item

95aced32-9f2c-4e2e-b78d-e48c15dc525c-2
00:17:39.985 --> 00:17:45.587
and succeeds it, that item will
go through a normal process of

95aced32-9f2c-4e2e-b78d-e48c15dc525c-3
00:17:45.587 --> 00:17:50.656
it being allocated to an SCT or
the item's gonna go to a

95aced32-9f2c-4e2e-b78d-e48c15dc525c-4
00:17:50.656 --> 00:17:51.990
purchase order.

0f85185a-63c0-4017-854a-5c348a05bb38-0
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.320
So.

c2a2e16a-bce8-4398-8e4a-8b7648c42833-0
00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:01.199
One state is if once all the
information has been set up for

c2a2e16a-bce8-4398-8e4a-8b7648c42833-1
00:18:01.199 --> 00:18:05.900
an SCT or purchase order to be
created, the automation will

c2a2e16a-bce8-4398-8e4a-8b7648c42833-2
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:10.210
eventually reprocess and try to
do that for that item.

e25532af-e657-4eac-94c1-4f91f0214612-0
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.584
So then it would it take into
account what ecap, what was

e25532af-e657-4eac-94c1-4f91f0214612-1
00:18:15.584 --> 00:18:17.660
entered through ecap to the
import?

8b95fafd-1c18-4454-9bdd-f625cd2da79a-0
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.180
Is what you're saying.

d3c12026-cb72-4b3d-ae50-295ac2dc28ed-0
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:20.440
Correct.

57228799-40bc-4886-be8b-56e179668a25-0
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.890
Yeah. What? We wouldn't want
that because I guess, I'm sorry.

8c0d382a-398f-4e03-9b22-0e7eb47d6902-0
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.290
What? What do you mean by?

de366678-480b-4522-9362-cda8aacb5f90-0
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.867
I'm understanding you as saying
like OK so if the order goes in

de366678-480b-4522-9362-cda8aacb5f90-1
00:18:32.867 --> 00:18:37.281
the DC selects, this is a in
store product so we don't need

de366678-480b-4522-9362-cda8aacb5f90-2
00:18:37.281 --> 00:18:40.150
to create a back order, but it's
like.

5bf09968-1523-4082-8a1d-778078a74278-0
00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.632
You know it's not an inventory,
so then it gets in the syspro

5bf09968-1523-4082-8a1d-778078a74278-1
00:18:44.632 --> 00:18:46.880
and it's put in the back order
status.

b2ab3050-1db6-43a1-ae32-ecba20f58e10-0
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.188
Uh, because the inventory is
inaccurate or the other example

b2ab3050-1db6-43a1-ae32-ecba20f58e10-1
00:18:51.188 --> 00:18:54.973
that the skin is not set up. So
therefore you know, we need to,

b2ab3050-1db6-43a1-ae32-ecba20f58e10-2
00:18:54.973 --> 00:18:58.463
you know, create the skew and
add it to the order and then

b2ab3050-1db6-43a1-ae32-ecba20f58e10-3
00:18:58.463 --> 00:18:59.410
generate the PO.

43c2fca2-cbc6-47eb-a2ac-6bdacea3b1ab-0
00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.525
But it sounded like what you
were saying was, OK, it'll run

43c2fca2-cbc6-47eb-a2ac-6bdacea3b1ab-1
00:19:03.525 --> 00:19:07.058
the first time and then it'll
obviously, you know, denote that

43c2fca2-cbc6-47eb-a2ac-6bdacea3b1ab-2
00:19:07.058 --> 00:19:10.142
it's an in stock. So therefore
it won't go through the

43c2fca2-cbc6-47eb-a2ac-6bdacea3b1ab-3
00:19:10.142 --> 00:19:13.844
automation process. But then the
next day or whenever it's rerun,

43c2fca2-cbc6-47eb-a2ac-6bdacea3b1ab-4
00:19:13.844 --> 00:19:17.489
if those items are still in the
back order then it'll run and go

43c2fca2-cbc6-47eb-a2ac-6bdacea3b1ab-5
00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:21.079
through the automation process
because it looks like it's still

43c2fca2-cbc6-47eb-a2ac-6bdacea3b1ab-6
00:19:21.079 --> 00:19:21.640
is needed.

c5d9cbbc-541f-4290-980a-b26d17211c67-0
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.403
So to me that you're saying that
it's trumping what the original

c5d9cbbc-541f-4290-980a-b26d17211c67-1
00:19:26.403 --> 00:19:29.360
request through Ecat was. Does
that make sense?

bbecc6f0-454a-4a4c-9fda-634db6b561d0-0
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:33.920
So what if I item is gonna use
in store?

ae7529b8-e754-48e9-bc5c-0ccb447d41a3-0
00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.990
Quantity. The automation's not
gonna do anything with it.

31314630-9818-4cdb-bba1-14884c55e1d1-0
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.480
Right. But then if you're
rerunning the automation, what

31314630-9818-4cdb-bba1-14884c55e1d1-1
00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.350
is the trigger to say that it
needs?

3cec8731-c0f8-43d3-bae4-edb4e02eb3d9-0
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.420
Something the back order.

01e5b5c4-4fc8-4193-8974-49785154989a-0
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.277
So what I was trying to say or
the question was if a newly

01e5b5c4-4fc8-4193-8974-49785154989a-1
00:19:57.277 --> 00:20:01.640
created SKU when it first comes
through.

85715ac4-e0b7-4ea3-83b3-322d3f14d6a1-0
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:07.543
Hmm. It there's not enough
information to know whether a

85715ac4-e0b7-4ea3-83b3-322d3f14d6a1-1
00:20:07.543 --> 00:20:11.370
SCT or purchase order is to be
done with.

61ee6715-f6b8-4a0e-8a1f-42488d19e81f-0
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:12.940
So.

493d2654-eb70-442a-bf4e-1a3124f052cb-0
00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:18.112
First step would be on the first
process that will be it will

493d2654-eb70-442a-bf4e-1a3124f052cb-1
00:20:18.112 --> 00:20:19.230
create a report.

444efbf1-d984-498e-aae4-6d781da3ea86-0
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:24.509
And send it out to whoever
needed to see that saying this

444efbf1-d984-498e-aae4-6d781da3ea86-1
00:20:24.509 --> 00:20:29.352
cells order this line number
could not be done. Nothing could

444efbf1-d984-498e-aae4-6d781da3ea86-2
00:20:29.352 --> 00:20:34.350
be done with it because further
action is required to know what

444efbf1-d984-498e-aae4-6d781da3ea86-3
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:39.115
to do with this. So this item we
know it needs to be special

444efbf1-d984-498e-aae4-6d781da3ea86-4
00:20:39.115 --> 00:20:39.740
ordered.

1285ee35-c38f-4355-8a87-c753477dc3b8-0
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:44.915
Um, through an SCT or purchase
order. It's just the automation

1285ee35-c38f-4355-8a87-c753477dc3b8-1
00:20:44.915 --> 00:20:49.270
doesn't know what to do with it,
so report has been sent out.

3cd456be-504a-4302-9d3c-dccce1d5d0d3-0
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:51.660
The question is what?

5210382c-2922-41f2-804a-c5b2bb40ea8d-0
00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:56.540
What further action needs to be
done for that item?

02b34602-bc11-481b-bb62-79abc10622f0-0
00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:01.130
So that's what I'm trying to
answer. What?

50c7a8c2-de39-48a3-8075-c5e28f674038-0
00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:09.529
I know is that the automation
continues to run and tries to

50c7a8c2-de39-48a3-8075-c5e28f674038-1
00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:13.290
attempt to fulfill these items.

4add8ab2-a8ab-460b-9574-5389e1d4d6fa-0
00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.670
Um, and in the automation just
to.

eb88fdbf-89f1-4b94-9d5e-f5031ab8939f-0
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.584
Calm some fears. It's not gonna
generate reports all the time

eb88fdbf-89f1-4b94-9d5e-f5031ab8939f-1
00:21:22.584 --> 00:21:25.490
for things that have already
been sent out.

bea6421d-659d-42fb-976f-ce4749be89bb-0
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:27.660
But.

8a34c330-a38a-4452-ab88-4a623f5b48b5-0
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.910
If the actions have been.

a297616a-9372-4028-acb7-eeec39f6acab-0
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:36.947
Uh, succeeded. Say the item is
something that Scott could be

a297616a-9372-4028-acb7-eeec39f6acab-1
00:21:36.947 --> 00:21:39.710
created for. That means the.

fc57d549-338a-4664-9806-4a0a41b87e57-0
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:46.663
The inventory records are there
to be for an SCT to be created.

fc57d549-338a-4664-9806-4a0a41b87e57-1
00:21:46.663 --> 00:21:52.450
The automation will just pick
that item up and create the SCT

fc57d549-338a-4664-9806-4a0a41b87e57-2
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.410
needed for that item.

c3df286c-0a9e-4595-b2c9-6c7f92ada169-0
00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:02.460
At a future point in time once
all records are in syspro.

054e0212-8fe1-4c86-bfc2-56687fa4ed9d-0
00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:08.220
Does everyone follow with that
line of thought?

28468144-334c-4b9f-b106-b1b0e05acdd6-0
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:13.820
I mean I yeah, I guess so.

7c0dc50b-488e-4b59-ac2e-18ba4d284871-0
00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:15.370
OK.

2372078c-cf40-4bea-9c47-e2212151472c-0
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:17.070
Like so.

f4957ed3-d20e-4878-88fc-f27e4d6f25af-0
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:19.410
Yeah.

d5bb238e-f8a5-4461-94b9-77fae33591b3-0
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:26.660
OK, so.

fe6aae77-82ea-44e1-8fe8-31ff5b2d7293-0
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.410
Thought processing? Yeah, I
think so.

216f1c40-e7bf-47f4-a44d-a1a2f6e50fd3-0
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.820
OK.

c7e4b218-c001-494c-be17-75e529325407-0
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.250
Um.

3a9cce7d-7fd4-4469-a9cb-73c5985ef403-0
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.738
What let let's talk about a
little bit of the current state

3a9cce7d-7fd4-4469-a9cb-73c5985ef403-1
00:22:42.738 --> 00:22:45.390
of how the back order review
starts.

03c91152-b3f0-442d-adbb-b4bf309475d0-0
00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:49.850
What?

0145f680-67d6-458b-b089-f4f040932423-0
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:55.848
Uh, statuses? Does the sales
order or the line line item need

0145f680-67d6-458b-b089-f4f040932423-1
00:22:55.848 --> 00:23:00.976
to have in order for someone to
start fulfilling a back order

0145f680-67d6-458b-b089-f4f040932423-2
00:23:00.976 --> 00:23:01.390
item?

f771060f-6dc1-415a-812f-9a7fc53187b1-0
00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:14.330
So what I understand is that
when a sales order comes in um,

f771060f-6dc1-415a-812f-9a7fc53187b1-1
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:20.307
there is a pending status the
sales order has and it first

f771060f-6dc1-415a-812f-9a7fc53187b1-2
00:23:20.307 --> 00:23:22.030
must be released.

9acf3819-4071-410b-bdaf-28acd8240516-0
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.700
And So what?

e1e6c63c-0363-4f34-8ba8-567575034c50-0
00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:30.338
What are the what? What does
that sales order look like when

e1e6c63c-0363-4f34-8ba8-567575034c50-1
00:23:30.338 --> 00:23:33.610
someone has released the order
to be processed?

a047a8fa-20e5-4f35-b03d-dcc9fdd4a3f7-0
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.690
It comes in as a forward order
for all the retail stores.

948310ac-afb2-4c88-a4bb-f098d08776d3-0
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:45.680
And then they have to. It comes
in as a Ford, FORDARD. Sorry,

948310ac-afb2-4c88-a4bb-f098d08776d3-1
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:50.280
mass. Southern accent doesn't
help. So F as in Brink.

c6d20d8c-3eec-41f0-a5da-46172fb65dd3-0
00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.048
And then we have to open the
order to be able to start the

c6d20d8c-3eec-41f0-a5da-46172fb65dd3-1
00:23:55.048 --> 00:23:57.840
processing, so we have to change
it from status F.

d1b4b403-5c30-482c-9cd9-2eea5fb31e28-0
00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:02.480
Two status, one for us to start
to activate the order.

0f08b833-73a3-4ca4-acaa-619192a9c2eb-0
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.675
And typically everything
defaults to the back order

0f08b833-73a3-4ca4-acaa-619192a9c2eb-1
00:24:14.675 --> 00:24:15.130
column.

9c7d3abe-1117-4944-ac2e-301612e4154d-0
00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:16.450
OK.

8484ed71-32cd-45c9-be3b-0c00de35b5b2-0
00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:21.246
And they will move things to the
shipped column if these are

8484ed71-32cd-45c9-be3b-0c00de35b5b2-1
00:24:21.246 --> 00:24:24.080
utilizing their store inventory.
That right Sean?

996bb37d-b3b1-46d4-a063-8a08f0a4d063-0
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:25.140
No.

d16cda90-0bce-433b-b2d3-231d014bbd7d-0
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.620
I mean, I would say.

4575dac1-bc99-4b4f-9b28-44214c2a0ec9-0
00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:44.591
I mean Alyssa, I mean to protect
us even more, I would put the

4575dac1-bc99-4b4f-9b28-44214c2a0ec9-1
00:24:44.591 --> 00:24:48.573
automation through unless we
have 50% deposit either, yeah,

4575dac1-bc99-4b4f-9b28-44214c2a0ec9-2
00:24:48.573 --> 00:24:52.488
that's true too, until the
payment is covers at least 50%.

4575dac1-bc99-4b4f-9b28-44214c2a0ec9-3
00:24:52.488 --> 00:24:55.210
Is there a way for us to do that
Justin?

da315efe-bd5e-4dd9-8983-0b7ee9aeb783-0
00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:01.056
I'll be able to figure out
whether or not an order has a

da315efe-bd5e-4dd9-8983-0b7ee9aeb783-1
00:25:01.056 --> 00:25:05.293
50% deposit on it. The only
thing that would go into

da315efe-bd5e-4dd9-8983-0b7ee9aeb783-2
00:25:05.293 --> 00:25:09.130
question there is for Wells
Fargo because they.

d7f24fa4-6637-4ea9-9f0a-8834f01e6856-0
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:14.110
We only require what is it 20%
down to place the order.

e648d3d5-cc59-4ce6-9b77-c84759fdcb2e-0
00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:21.410
For Wells Fargo for 15% down,
because you do.

f912afe3-83ae-4db4-84fb-8caef5e9249f-0
00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:26.181
Could in they could. When you do
the automation well, it's

f912afe3-83ae-4db4-84fb-8caef5e9249f-1
00:25:26.181 --> 00:25:27.680
automation run that's not.

1549a610-731b-4f6a-ada1-39cf52ab1ff6-0
00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.237
I was gonna say could there be
like a like when you open the

1549a610-731b-4f6a-ada1-39cf52ab1ff6-1
00:25:32.237 --> 00:25:35.228
order you know put do you want
this order to go through

1549a610-731b-4f6a-ada1-39cf52ab1ff6-2
00:25:35.228 --> 00:25:36.670
automation and then hit OK.

62c5ec74-c310-406b-b3fb-3742f1a49c33-0
00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.280
But that does not. That's not
automation, so no it.

43bbddaa-b95b-49f3-8140-70183147cd12-0
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:46.870
The automation will continually
run in the background until the.

522b3b51-8365-44b3-a0d0-7f10aca072e7-0
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:52.517
You know the specific conditions
to where the automation can look

522b3b51-8365-44b3-a0d0-7f10aca072e7-1
00:25:52.517 --> 00:25:54.570
at an order to be processed.

5dd07fa9-8e37-4cba-8075-c42da423bcc3-0
00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.945
So let me ask you this question
because I'm going to make it

5dd07fa9-8e37-4cba-8075-c42da423bcc3-1
00:25:58.945 --> 00:26:01.474
complicated so if it's
consistently running in the

5dd07fa9-8e37-4cba-8075-c42da423bcc3-2
00:26:01.474 --> 00:26:02.020
background.

aecd69f5-e057-443d-847e-957fc2daf383-0
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.520
Umm.

af12008b-e19d-4f58-b430-c70494b36d42-0
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:09.579
It's OK, we potentially have
three different SAT's for one

af12008b-e19d-4f58-b430-c70494b36d42-1
00:26:09.579 --> 00:26:10.380
order if.

23fb04e0-17e2-4dab-b0c7-c8348cfc931f-0
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:13.510
You run the order.

528c8020-f794-4ab7-bc1b-a10df5f11609-0
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:16.370
And.

fd242a18-a27b-4e3e-a424-0952459c861b-0
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:22.399
The order is put in and it's put
in with majority of the correct

fd242a18-a27b-4e3e-a424-0952459c861b-1
00:26:22.399 --> 00:26:24.060
SKUs. It has an SC-1.

21f7cafd-9321-449d-a2e3-5fae1301c3a2-0
00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.947
Maybe has two different SC dash
ones for this particular

21f7cafd-9321-449d-a2e3-5fae1301c3a2-1
00:26:29.947 --> 00:26:34.141
perspectives, so the first round
of the order goes through is an

21f7cafd-9321-449d-a2e3-5fae1301c3a2-2
00:26:34.141 --> 00:26:34.399
SCT.

080d2301-8203-4419-b884-c9af3451909e-0
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:40.116
But we're still waiting on that
fill and skew to come in or

080d2301-8203-4419-b884-c9af3451909e-1
00:26:40.116 --> 00:26:44.586
we're waiting on approval for
that skew to be released. So

080d2301-8203-4419-b884-c9af3451909e-2
00:26:44.586 --> 00:26:44.890
i.e.

11e163bc-b6d4-439f-bc58-15f3fd50543b-0
00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.450
A cushion that's discontinued
and we're waiting on.

885d2282-9f26-424c-a598-1f1dc4f5f809-0
00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.640
Jeannie and IT to make sure that
we do actually physically have

885d2282-9f26-424c-a598-1f1dc4f5f809-1
00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.280
that product.

fd41eaa2-9e4f-4b06-a44f-2305e8675aff-0
00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:00.519
For whatever in the world we
might need it for or that we can

fd41eaa2-9e4f-4b06-a44f-2305e8675aff-1
00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:04.048
use that fabric. So could I
potentially have three

fd41eaa2-9e4f-4b06-a44f-2305e8675aff-2
00:27:04.048 --> 00:27:04.740
different?

2f6b84df-7aa2-447c-9795-41819a9d9eff-0
00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:10.032
Or two. Even two. As little as
two two different SAT's. Because

2f6b84df-7aa2-447c-9795-41819a9d9eff-1
00:27:10.032 --> 00:27:14.141
automation is consistently
running, looking for this excuse

2f6b84df-7aa2-447c-9795-41819a9d9eff-2
00:27:14.141 --> 00:27:15.100
to go through.

2f83ff8d-6c92-40cf-809c-06b7c2682dce-0
00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.547
So that, I'm sorry, I'm being
very complicated, but I just

2f83ff8d-6c92-40cf-809c-06b7c2682dce-1
00:27:20.547 --> 00:27:24.960
know we use discontinued fabric
a lot, so we're having to unbox

2f83ff8d-6c92-40cf-809c-06b7c2682dce-2
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.270
these consistently.

d0782be8-a454-4c95-a6b3-8d286aeb23cd-0
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:33.809
More complicated thing. So OK,
when this process runs, it can

d0782be8-a454-4c95-a6b3-8d286aeb23cd-1
00:27:33.809 --> 00:27:39.719
just immediately create an SCT
or allocate items to an SCT on

d0782be8-a454-4c95-a6b3-8d286aeb23cd-2
00:27:39.719 --> 00:27:45.820
the fly, regardless of whether
or not it can fulfill the entire

d0782be8-a454-4c95-a6b3-8d286aeb23cd-3
00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:52.111
order on a set or purchase order
combination. Or we can set it up

d0782be8-a454-4c95-a6b3-8d286aeb23cd-4
00:27:52.111 --> 00:27:57.639
to where it will only put items
on an set if it is fully.

bb77b438-64bd-4d65-8663-3c8d097c32a1-0
00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:02.110
Um, Kim, fully fulfill the
order?

abd2edaf-3412-4308-8647-66957c22a478-0
00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:07.227
So the question is, what do you
want? Do you want multiple sets

abd2edaf-3412-4308-8647-66957c22a478-1
00:28:07.227 --> 00:28:11.576
per order or do you want it only
on one set? If possible, OK, one

abd2edaf-3412-4308-8647-66957c22a478-2
00:28:11.576 --> 00:28:15.332
if possible. It's gonna be one
set per where the product

abd2edaf-3412-4308-8647-66957c22a478-3
00:28:15.332 --> 00:28:19.418
resides, so one per Montebello,
one per main, until we get to

abd2edaf-3412-4308-8647-66957c22a478-4
00:28:19.418 --> 00:28:23.437
the point where all product
doesn't matter what warehouse it

abd2edaf-3412-4308-8647-66957c22a478-5
00:28:23.437 --> 00:28:24.689
comes out of which.

47bd1874-17a0-4d00-a23b-dc499f894a27-0
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.600
This sounds like a year or so.

39570296-abfa-4918-a116-f1433eb6fe3b-0
00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.030
Um.

49ab06ad-0eb9-4f5c-9d71-6c9c7dbd643f-0
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:35.160
One per SCT or one SCT per?

205bd2d6-1f4d-4789-bc04-920a51a40bea-0
00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.750
I or ohh golly or warehouse or
warehouse um.

af0edb3c-bc3c-46e3-a90b-8613c1fd2ac5-0
00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.910
So order comes in.

b1fd301c-6cca-41ae-a1de-7d3f84072bba-0
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:50.928
It has items that could fulfill
on multiple from multiple

b1fd301c-6cca-41ae-a1de-7d3f84072bba-1
00:28:50.928 --> 00:28:56.879
warehouses, but it does have one
item or two items that it can't,

b1fd301c-6cca-41ae-a1de-7d3f84072bba-2
00:28:56.879 --> 00:29:02.288
it can't process right now. So
if that's the case, it's not

b1fd301c-6cca-41ae-a1de-7d3f84072bba-3
00:29:02.288 --> 00:29:07.607
going to submit those sets to
those warehouses until those

b1fd301c-6cca-41ae-a1de-7d3f84072bba-4
00:29:07.607 --> 00:29:09.050
final two items.

006d3df4-697e-4a12-b6e8-91cc7c85d06c-0
00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:15.610
Can be can be purchased or SCT.
Is that correct?

87fef386-0ee9-4a6f-8ad7-56555b460fcd-0
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.620
Yes, OK. OK.

1f672732-8fd6-4783-8817-2c0002725a95-0
00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:27.609
And the same thing will happen
for purchase order items. If the

1f672732-8fd6-4783-8817-2c0002725a95-1
00:29:27.609 --> 00:29:33.014
items can't be put on a purchase
order or can't be put on SCT,

1f672732-8fd6-4783-8817-2c0002725a95-2
00:29:33.014 --> 00:29:36.960
the whole entire order will not
be fulfilled.

94efd387-f2c4-4c93-a0ba-3c49f3f8ec7c-0
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:42.660
I would say yes.

9b295281-aac6-4b16-829e-6308ff6fc4d7-0
00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.700


4dd4267e-2512-4baf-a000-4bbf618d5099-0
00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:06.740
OK.

b8d40104-c773-407e-b492-19fa9e156e62-0
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:13.539
When, when's what? What's the
timeline of this to complete? Is

b8d40104-c773-407e-b492-19fa9e156e62-1
00:30:13.539 --> 00:30:16.370
it by end of quarter two? Is
that right?

0a16f43b-afa9-4ee7-8324-633a7c120e19-0
00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.100
Uh. I?

b9f41fac-2838-426f-80e9-2b95435894fb-0
00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.750
I believe so, yes.

66106eaa-c99e-477e-8839-28e134d4a8c2-0
00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:29.724
I'll I'll have to get with
people to confirm that or not.

66106eaa-c99e-477e-8839-28e134d4a8c2-1
00:30:29.724 --> 00:30:31.200
Yeah, for sure. Um.

1a9d41e4-b52c-41a4-ac17-77d492640d16-0
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.860
There's just going to be a lot
of training because we haven't

1a9d41e4-b52c-41a4-ac17-77d492640d16-1
00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.538
gotten into it yet. But when the
DC puts in the order and they

1a9d41e4-b52c-41a4-ac17-77d492640d16-2
00:30:41.538 --> 00:30:44.983
request it to ship this way,
it's got to be exact. Because

1a9d41e4-b52c-41a4-ac17-77d492640d16-3
00:30:44.983 --> 00:30:48.428
then when it goes through the
automation and you put it to

1a9d41e4-b52c-41a4-ac17-77d492640d16-4
00:30:48.428 --> 00:30:52.106
ship, you know, to the three PL.
but they wanted it shipped to

1a9d41e4-b52c-41a4-ac17-77d492640d16-5
00:30:52.106 --> 00:30:55.025
the store directly to the
customer if they select

1a9d41e4-b52c-41a4-ac17-77d492640d16-6
00:30:55.025 --> 00:30:55.959
something wrong.

81db8e0a-b17a-4fac-b963-50a8fbd1d3f0-0
00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.444
At the time of entry that's
going to mess up, you know,

81db8e0a-b17a-4fac-b963-50a8fbd1d3f0-1
00:31:00.444 --> 00:31:03.841
everything on the back end. So
we we just will have a huge

81db8e0a-b17a-4fac-b963-50a8fbd1d3f0-2
00:31:03.841 --> 00:31:04.360
training.

d4e69fe2-9fd4-4d8e-bf7c-e3b721f921af-0
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.890
Timeline. So I just want to make
sure that that's included in the

d4e69fe2-9fd4-4d8e-bf7c-e3b721f921af-1
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:09.410
timeline.

d9e3301c-a148-4a6a-b956-b4e25b790505-0
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:13.559
Of the rollout, so we just don't
you know, say oh we're we did

d9e3301c-a148-4a6a-b956-b4e25b790505-1
00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:16.938
all the IT work and let's roll
it out and then we're sitting

d9e3301c-a148-4a6a-b956-b4e25b790505-2
00:31:16.938 --> 00:31:20.373
here struggling on the on the
back end. So just a heads up on

d9e3301c-a148-4a6a-b956-b4e25b790505-3
00:31:20.373 --> 00:31:20.650
that.

5f4ba32a-4091-4f68-8aa5-ba2064fe9403-0
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:25.106
Because right now we're not
doing that correctly. I mean

5f4ba32a-4091-4f68-8aa5-ba2064fe9403-1
00:31:25.106 --> 00:31:28.449
right now the, the, I mean, even
though we've done out training

5f4ba32a-4091-4f68-8aa5-ba2064fe9403-2
00:31:28.449 --> 00:31:31.844
on what storage are supposed to
select, I mean DC's aren't doing

5f4ba32a-4091-4f68-8aa5-ba2064fe9403-3
00:31:31.844 --> 00:31:34.560
that correct right now. So it's
going to be a huge.

f9ca4c12-c1e0-477c-8277-eb1e4ad83b19-0
00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.580
A huge training opportunity for
us.

f3a8b942-9005-4db9-bdc8-d4cb6d212ae5-0
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.070
OK.

15221212-3231-42a8-9158-9740f41a1901-0
00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:41.910
Uh.

3f601446-63d4-4b64-9e7a-2a4673b859d1-0
00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.560
So what?

bd2e1ca2-5374-4596-8827-80a0afc46d8c-0
00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:49.960
Just to kind of dig into this
real quick. Um.

7c250dd4-d63b-41ae-9478-eb4e7fadfcc8-0
00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:55.560
What what are some of these
specific items that need to be

7c250dd4-d63b-41ae-9478-eb4e7fadfcc8-1
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.311
fully fulfilled for an SCT or
purchase order to occur? All

7c250dd4-d63b-41ae-9478-eb4e7fadfcc8-2
00:31:59.311 --> 00:32:03.190
right, let me I gotta log into
syspro to give you the exact.

747f2e17-58d7-43d4-b60a-98d2ca3d0f81-0
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:12.120
Barber all the fun stuff. So
when an order goes in, we have.

35817c92-bfd1-4c7c-aab7-05fb1e933e86-0
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.610
I mean essentially.

20a6c89b-8c4d-4db9-b817-be9d15448377-0
00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:20.980
Three main ways that it could
get delivered to the customer.

84970fdf-ef21-40a7-af23-cf6fc6c5ca20-0
00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:25.587
3 avenues. And then there's two
different types in those

84970fdf-ef21-40a7-af23-cf6fc6c5ca20-1
00:32:25.587 --> 00:32:29.662
avenues. So for instance, a
customer order something, they

84970fdf-ef21-40a7-af23-cf6fc6c5ca20-2
00:32:29.662 --> 00:32:33.945
want it delivered to their home
and they live within 100 mile

84970fdf-ef21-40a7-af23-cf6fc6c5ca20-3
00:32:33.945 --> 00:32:38.159
radius of the store today that
goes through what we call our

84970fdf-ef21-40a7-af23-cf6fc6c5ca20-4
00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:42.096
local white glove delivery
process. So when the order is

84970fdf-ef21-40a7-af23-cf6fc6c5ca20-5
00:32:42.096 --> 00:32:44.100
placed and the SAT is placed.

b832ce8d-5db0-41b0-88bb-a72af88aabad-0
00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:49.987
Those orders go full truckload
from the distribution center to

b832ce8d-5db0-41b0-88bb-a72af88aabad-1
00:32:49.987 --> 00:32:50.640
our 3PO.

c2372f93-7cc5-49ea-beb7-295070cb2035-0
00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:57.771
So the St. is gonna have SC
truckload for. That's what I'm

c2372f93-7cc5-49ea-beb7-295070cb2035-1
00:32:57.771 --> 00:33:00.660
logging into. See if I can.

3eb2d185-5952-4c9e-95d6-14809e9e30e1-0
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.869
Get in but and then it's going
to be standard ship. And then

3eb2d185-5952-4c9e-95d6-14809e9e30e1-1
00:33:04.869 --> 00:33:08.593
three PL. is the selected. Those
are the three main things that

3eb2d185-5952-4c9e-95d6-14809e9e30e1-2
00:33:08.593 --> 00:33:09.350
are selected.

44ebf797-20d1-4b1a-b1a0-f2f67636df26-0
00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:11.520
Ohm.

9d9e1412-e2ac-453a-99d8-ca2e3737ccc4-0
00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:16.278
Then if but if the customer you
know lives outside of the the

9d9e1412-e2ac-453a-99d8-ca2e3737ccc4-1
00:33:16.278 --> 00:33:19.510
three PL. and we're shipping it
to them and they need white

9d9e1412-e2ac-453a-99d8-ca2e3737ccc4-2
00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:22.580
glove, well that's going prepaid
freight it's not going.

c6a98c54-750e-4112-82b9-e918f68c13f4-0
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:27.559
So the so the ship via code is
going to be SC truckload for

c6a98c54-750e-4112-82b9-e918f68c13f4-1
00:33:27.559 --> 00:33:32.228
three PL. and I can we're going
to have to probably map this out

c6a98c54-750e-4112-82b9-e918f68c13f4-2
00:33:32.228 --> 00:33:36.466
so we'll have to do that for
sure but it would be SC truck

c6a98c54-750e-4112-82b9-e918f68c13f4-3
00:33:36.466 --> 00:33:41.207
load it would be address type is
the second one and that would be

c6a98c54-750e-4112-82b9-e918f68c13f4-4
00:33:41.207 --> 00:33:42.499
for A3PO would be.

c2a0b95b-00e0-4410-b560-061ace3b8ef8-0
00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.742
Three PL. it's, it's actually
the the name of it and then

c2a0b95b-00e0-4410-b560-061ace3b8ef8-1
00:33:47.742 --> 00:33:51.655
delivery type would be standard,
but if a customer had that

c2a0b95b-00e0-4410-b560-061ace3b8ef8-2
00:33:51.655 --> 00:33:55.568
range, it would be prepaid
freight, it would be residential

c2a0b95b-00e0-4410-b560-061ace3b8ef8-3
00:33:55.568 --> 00:33:59.089
and then then the delivery type
would be white glove.

81a726b2-5529-4ee3-a834-f5cd6354ae91-0
00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:00.560
Um.

a7efffd8-fb3c-4e2d-97e4-1e728c703030-0
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.754
And these are all just triggers
that traffic is asked us now if

a7efffd8-fb3c-4e2d-97e4-1e728c703030-1
00:34:04.754 --> 00:34:05.630
you talk to Ben.

1c8ba9c1-da1e-43be-a945-ecea69a02171-0
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:10.460
You know, he believes a
different way I think. And then

1c8ba9c1-da1e-43be-a945-ecea69a02171-1
00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:14.222
obviously from an accounting
perspective it's different. It

1c8ba9c1-da1e-43be-a945-ecea69a02171-2
00:34:14.222 --> 00:34:17.858
should be different from the
order from the 300 side than

1c8ba9c1-da1e-43be-a945-ecea69a02171-3
00:34:17.858 --> 00:34:21.808
what the SCT reads and so, but I
know when the import comes in

1c8ba9c1-da1e-43be-a945-ecea69a02171-4
00:34:21.808 --> 00:34:24.630
from ecat, it's, you know,
putting whatever.

de86002a-1d70-4473-8e7a-06830e327520-0
00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:28.730
We've required so it doesn't
copy over.

7249639a-4c76-4f88-a8b2-f134098c336d-0
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.000
Because the relationship between
the store and the customer is

7249639a-4c76-4f88-a8b2-f134098c336d-1
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:33.890
one thing. And then.

02fbed24-a002-4173-9c99-3c3e542bbead-0
00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.860
The the actual shipment is a
different thing.

9f2d7a89-7e67-4c84-adea-82b29123cfc2-0
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:44.660
Um, and then the other way would
be, you know that it's going to.

7047e8f6-13e6-403f-96d7-85227e6f2c04-0
00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:46.210
It's just a.

d49b6ac1-04d7-46c1-b1d0-6e161a741604-0
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:51.500
Drop ship, you know, so it would
be again prepaid standard.

b74be1a4-fe39-46fe-9b66-8cf20d517f49-0
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:55.110
Residential or commercial
depending on where it's being

b74be1a4-fe39-46fe-9b66-8cf20d517f49-1
00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:57.850
shipped to and then standard
shipment and that would.

e0111c73-0053-4f01-8a93-dc6ec4c70b1d-0
00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:01.723
And that all those are, you
know, selected so that when the

e0111c73-0053-4f01-8a93-dc6ec4c70b1d-1
00:35:01.723 --> 00:35:04.869
traffic gets the ticket, they
know how to ship it to the end

e0111c73-0053-4f01-8a93-dc6ec4c70b1d-2
00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:07.859
consumer or wherever we're
asking it to be shipped to and

e0111c73-0053-4f01-8a93-dc6ec4c70b1d-3
00:35:07.859 --> 00:35:10.180
then obviously the address would
change, so.

afd752fe-634a-4df1-ac40-4229c9a6daaf-0
00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:15.243
The address right now on the
ecad import comes as is the

afd752fe-634a-4df1-ac40-4229c9a6daaf-1
00:35:15.243 --> 00:35:16.530
customer address.

bcf99e24-62f0-4843-b627-08f9ff7c43c1-0
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.904
But obviously if we want it
shipped to the third, third

bcf99e24-62f0-4843-b627-08f9ff7c43c1-1
00:35:20.904 --> 00:35:23.260
party vendor or you know,
whatever.

07fb65f5-6103-40cb-b1db-f5f5a4a127c9-0
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:27.312
Um, that address, you know would
have to be the third party

07fb65f5-6103-40cb-b1db-f5f5a4a127c9-1
00:35:27.312 --> 00:35:30.618
vendor. So like right now when
you generate a supply chain

07fb65f5-6103-40cb-b1db-f5f5a4a127c9-2
00:35:30.618 --> 00:35:33.644
transfer, we have a default
address and a lot of them

07fb65f5-6103-40cb-b1db-f5f5a4a127c9-3
00:35:33.644 --> 00:35:37.119
because about 85% of our orders
are shipping to the three PL.

07fb65f5-6103-40cb-b1db-f5f5a4a127c9-4
00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:40.649
85. That's the default address
for most of the stores is their

07fb65f5-6103-40cb-b1db-f5f5a4a127c9-5
00:35:40.649 --> 00:35:44.180
local 3 PL. But if they want to
ship it to the end consumer or

07fb65f5-6103-40cb-b1db-f5f5a4a127c9-6
00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.542
they want to ship it to, you
know, some other address, they

07fb65f5-6103-40cb-b1db-f5f5a4a127c9-7
00:35:47.542 --> 00:35:51.241
would have to manually go in and
change that as the way that it's

07fb65f5-6103-40cb-b1db-f5f5a4a127c9-8
00:35:51.241 --> 00:35:51.970
set up today.

6b13273c-506a-4450-b574-7eb9800bd61a-0
00:35:53.100 --> 00:36:00.244
OK, so that manual process is
all that information within

6b13273c-506a-4450-b574-7eb9800bd61a-1
00:36:00.244 --> 00:36:01.600
syspro, so?

7dc10c76-afec-4cba-a749-4ba31238ca9a-0
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:07.701
The order comes in I I know, I I
can figure out what the store

7dc10c76-afec-4cba-a749-4ba31238ca9a-1
00:36:07.701 --> 00:36:12.815
address is and the, uh, the
three PL. addresses. I as long

7dc10c76-afec-4cba-a749-4ba31238ca9a-2
00:36:12.815 --> 00:36:18.017
as the customer address is on
that ecat order, I know where

7dc10c76-afec-4cba-a749-4ba31238ca9a-3
00:36:18.017 --> 00:36:23.304
the where the customer address
is and the script can be sent

7dc10c76-afec-4cba-a749-4ba31238ca9a-4
00:36:23.304 --> 00:36:28.332
there. There's no case in
scenario that it's not going to

7dc10c76-afec-4cba-a749-4ba31238ca9a-5
00:36:28.332 --> 00:36:30.759
be those addresses, correct?

267f7d37-73f2-4ed9-98a0-19338f27f321-0
00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.672
It could be the customer's
address, yeah, if we're shipping

267f7d37-73f2-4ed9-98a0-19338f27f321-1
00:36:35.672 --> 00:36:39.280
it direct to them, right? So I
know data wise, I know the

267f7d37-73f2-4ed9-98a0-19338f27f321-2
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:43.075
customer address, I know the
store address, I know the three

267f7d37-73f2-4ed9-98a0-19338f27f321-3
00:36:43.075 --> 00:36:46.869
PL. address. There's not any
other address that it could be.

2ed31e57-2817-4131-ba11-051cbc82c10d-0
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:54.110
I mean yes, technically like so
this happens sometimes like we

2ed31e57-2817-4131-ba11-051cbc82c10d-1
00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:57.130
set up a customer account and
they move.

d2e1cf28-8a54-4730-b1bd-a09d947cc66c-0
00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:02.023
Well, the customer address is
different than what they want it

d2e1cf28-8a54-4730-b1bd-a09d947cc66c-1
00:37:02.023 --> 00:37:06.074
shipped to or they're ordering
for their beach house and so

d2e1cf28-8a54-4730-b1bd-a09d947cc66c-2
00:37:06.074 --> 00:37:10.126
that's a different app. So I
mean yes there is that address

d2e1cf28-8a54-4730-b1bd-a09d947cc66c-3
00:37:10.126 --> 00:37:14.312
says change. Now I think what I
I think the easiest way to do

d2e1cf28-8a54-4730-b1bd-a09d947cc66c-4
00:37:14.312 --> 00:37:14.650
this.

82367fa2-6eec-4693-a47a-3425f4961c50-0
00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.860
Is to probably go back to Ecap.

88a0a58b-21f8-4a0f-a9b3-e6dbba1cbbc8-0
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.420
And get.

587def3f-6712-49af-af20-2cd8e624388b-0
00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:25.772
Like we had asked for this a
while back and I don't know if

587def3f-6712-49af-af20-2cd8e624388b-1
00:37:25.772 --> 00:37:29.180
it's a possibility now, but is
like if.

4b4c671f-369f-4e98-a91c-8c2b7a569da3-0
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:35.098
Like because all this
information is selectable in

4b4c671f-369f-4e98-a91c-8c2b7a569da3-1
00:37:35.098 --> 00:37:38.943
ekat today. Like meaning you
know the ship to and all that,

4b4c671f-369f-4e98-a91c-8c2b7a569da3-2
00:37:38.943 --> 00:37:39.200
but.

58c6c054-e680-49c4-bd31-644fe75c0fa7-0
00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.490
So my suggestion is if.

7f2cd41f-d583-4bc1-97d0-17b288eedc4b-0
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:47.871
The order you know is selected
for three PL. you know that

7f2cd41f-d583-4bc1-97d0-17b288eedc4b-1
00:37:47.871 --> 00:37:51.677
would just be the selection and
everything else defaults you

7f2cd41f-d583-4bc1-97d0-17b288eedc4b-2
00:37:51.677 --> 00:37:54.610
know to what needs to be
imported into syspro.

6cc0d9c7-55d5-44de-81b4-60a441e75645-0
00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:59.914
Like I don't know if there's
like if it can get that granular

6cc0d9c7-55d5-44de-81b4-60a441e75645-1
00:37:59.914 --> 00:38:03.844
in ecat where like we have
profiles within you know ecat

6cc0d9c7-55d5-44de-81b4-60a441e75645-2
00:38:03.844 --> 00:38:07.981
like if it's a three PL. their
you know address is pre, you

6cc0d9c7-55d5-44de-81b4-60a441e75645-3
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:12.325
know populated, you know it's
all the options that we need for

6cc0d9c7-55d5-44de-81b4-60a441e75645-4
00:38:12.325 --> 00:38:16.668
that item to ship out correctly
as populated. So that way when

6cc0d9c7-55d5-44de-81b4-60a441e75645-5
00:38:16.668 --> 00:38:21.012
it does import it's going you
know straight into that but it's

6cc0d9c7-55d5-44de-81b4-60a441e75645-6
00:38:21.012 --> 00:38:25.149
also not relying on a DC to know
the address or to know the

6cc0d9c7-55d5-44de-81b4-60a441e75645-7
00:38:25.149 --> 00:38:25.769
specific.

7184de41-8a6c-4a92-9af1-0567475cd9b8-0
00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:29.750
You know qualifications for
this? Like it? It's simplified

7184de41-8a6c-4a92-9af1-0567475cd9b8-1
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:30.410
basically.

f9626b5e-5810-4387-b613-8615b431a83b-0
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.130
Sure. Um.

309187ea-f49c-40e6-9b16-ae88fd5401c2-0
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.060
That's probably a better
question.

e60e861d-333d-4c91-a715-baf6942b412c-0
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:41.154
Yeah, I would have to look
through the address validation

e60e861d-333d-4c91-a715-baf6942b412c-1
00:38:41.154 --> 00:38:42.060
perspective too.

5d8ce109-a41b-4ad5-98e5-47b6830ba0c0-0
00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:47.640
Well, the algers validation is
just when a DC puts in like 3140

5d8ce109-a41b-4ad5-98e5-47b6830ba0c0-1
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:51.500
Pelham Parkway and they do
PELHEM, you know and then it

5d8ce109-a41b-4ad5-98e5-47b6830ba0c0-2
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.566
says well no, it's really this
treasure, it's this, I mean

5d8ce109-a41b-4ad5-98e5-47b6830ba0c0-3
00:38:55.566 --> 00:38:59.770
that's just validating since
accurate address not that it's.

4a7a01be-6d54-42bb-9e18-6580a4db07b1-0
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:01.760
What you want, you know?

91699172-7b6a-4423-adf5-54f0f1b63ee1-0
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.090
Understandable.

e7c0cde7-43d4-4427-acfe-1a04f8313933-0
00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:10.511
We should be able to figure out
the correct shipment and what is

e7c0cde7-43d4-4427-acfe-1a04f8313933-1
00:39:10.511 --> 00:39:14.283
required. And it may be that we
need to go back and simplify how

e7c0cde7-43d4-4427-acfe-1a04f8313933-2
00:39:14.283 --> 00:39:17.648
it ships. I mean that to Ben's
point. I mean, he's always

e7c0cde7-43d4-4427-acfe-1a04f8313933-3
00:39:17.648 --> 00:39:21.130
questioned like why are we doing
it this way, you know, so.

42a4d5ff-d07a-4d55-93c0-6a70c4e4b9d4-0
00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:25.331
Sure, there it may be that we
have to change that, but that

42a4d5ff-d07a-4d55-93c0-6a70c4e4b9d4-1
00:39:25.331 --> 00:39:29.008
would be looping in the traffic,
you know, because some of the

42a4d5ff-d07a-4d55-93c0-6a70c4e4b9d4-2
00:39:29.008 --> 00:39:32.627
reason why we do it is like for
instance the three PO we pull

42a4d5ff-d07a-4d55-93c0-6a70c4e4b9d4-3
00:39:32.627 --> 00:39:36.362
out because we don't want it to
go through the mode network and

42a4d5ff-d07a-4d55-93c0-6a70c4e4b9d4-4
00:39:36.362 --> 00:39:37.530
the traffic team is.

81257218-d10a-46f6-a970-87fb17ed2c8e-0
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:41.872
Just taking full truck carriers
and assigning that rather than

81257218-d10a-46f6-a970-87fb17ed2c8e-1
00:39:41.872 --> 00:39:43.110
having all the orders.

dff7aada-a71f-4d59-b251-0183f70ca13f-0
00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:48.875
Auto feed through mode, you know
and then selecting a carrier and

dff7aada-a71f-4d59-b251-0183f70ca13f-1
00:39:48.875 --> 00:39:53.553
then you know. So the reason why
we do see truckload is because

dff7aada-a71f-4d59-b251-0183f70ca13f-2
00:39:53.553 --> 00:39:56.990
SC truckload option doesn't auto
feed to mode.

b09eceb1-b665-4533-ba09-345b5ebf20c5-0
00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:01.586
OK. So that's why we changed
that the prepaid does. So any

b09eceb1-b665-4533-ba09-345b5ebf20c5-1
00:40:01.586 --> 00:40:05.309
prepaid order goes through the
mode system. It auto rates, you

b09eceb1-b665-4533-ba09-345b5ebf20c5-2
00:40:05.309 --> 00:40:08.796
know a truck company and it
comes back to the distribution

b09eceb1-b665-4533-ba09-345b5ebf20c5-3
00:40:08.796 --> 00:40:12.342
center and then the ticket
prints and then they go pick the

b09eceb1-b665-4533-ba09-345b5ebf20c5-4
00:40:12.342 --> 00:40:15.946
order and ship it, you know
based on what mode selected as a

b09eceb1-b665-4533-ba09-345b5ebf20c5-5
00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:19.729
carrier. So that's some of the
reason why we did it, but it was

b09eceb1-b665-4533-ba09-345b5ebf20c5-6
00:40:19.729 --> 00:40:20.319
really to.

46613bf3-90c6-40c9-a203-0d5aca4082c9-0
00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:24.636
To pull out now, it has caused
some issues like for instance

46613bf3-90c6-40c9-a203-0d5aca4082c9-1
00:40:24.636 --> 00:40:27.996
all the stores now that's their
default that they use. So now

46613bf3-90c6-40c9-a203-0d5aca4082c9-2
00:40:27.996 --> 00:40:31.248
like for Claremont orders where
we do want it to be prepaid

46613bf3-90c6-40c9-a203-0d5aca4082c9-3
00:40:31.248 --> 00:40:34.717
because it's going on furniture
carrier. We're always having to

46613bf3-90c6-40c9-a203-0d5aca4082c9-4
00:40:34.717 --> 00:40:37.914
go back in and update it or
change it because stores were,

46613bf3-90c6-40c9-a203-0d5aca4082c9-5
00:40:37.914 --> 00:40:41.383
you know, leaving it that way.
So I would love it would solve a

46613bf3-90c6-40c9-a203-0d5aca4082c9-6
00:40:41.383 --> 00:40:43.660
lot of issues if we can on the
front end.

72510708-05dd-47da-9bb1-a364d2ab3c4c-0
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:48.063
You know, if you want like how
do you want this order shipped?

72510708-05dd-47da-9bb1-a364d2ab3c4c-1
00:40:48.063 --> 00:40:51.543
You know, as a question and then
and then and the stores say

72510708-05dd-47da-9bb1-a364d2ab3c4c-2
00:40:51.543 --> 00:40:54.852
local 3PO and they select that,
it auto populates all the

72510708-05dd-47da-9bb1-a364d2ab3c4c-3
00:40:54.852 --> 00:40:58.275
information. So they're not
having to select currently like

72510708-05dd-47da-9bb1-a364d2ab3c4c-4
00:40:58.275 --> 00:41:01.697
they are. You know, each one of
the options in Ecuador just

72510708-05dd-47da-9bb1-a364d2ab3c4c-5
00:41:01.697 --> 00:41:03.009
could be a quick thing.

f460ac8a-47a1-490d-a6bc-7b2c02071cca-0
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:08.110
OK. So just to round out the
shipment thing.

43e19b28-dfbb-46f7-8126-617404878c82-0
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:14.901
For the the automation, it needs
to know what type of shipment

43e19b28-dfbb-46f7-8126-617404878c82-1
00:41:14.901 --> 00:41:20.718
that the order is going to be
processed in and based off what

43e19b28-dfbb-46f7-8126-617404878c82-2
00:41:20.718 --> 00:41:25.691
this type is, the SC2 or
purchase order will use the

43e19b28-dfbb-46f7-8126-617404878c82-3
00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:31.039
selected type to know what ship
address to use. Correct?

43e19b28-dfbb-46f7-8126-617404878c82-4
00:41:31.039 --> 00:41:31.790
Correct.

8e7539e4-37ee-4a1f-84a0-9aea1cc70b3b-0
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:33.090
And.

00150816-58c3-4065-adbe-85e4b81da855-0
00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:41.037
To try to run down the different
types, there's or is it just two

00150816-58c3-4065-adbe-85e4b81da855-1
00:41:41.037 --> 00:41:46.503
basically a customer specific
specified address and the three

00150816-58c3-4065-adbe-85e4b81da855-2
00:41:46.503 --> 00:41:51.703
PL. address, no, it's three.
It's local 3 PL. what we call

00150816-58c3-4065-adbe-85e4b81da855-3
00:41:51.703 --> 00:41:56.816
national three PL. or it's
outside of the local delivery,

00150816-58c3-4065-adbe-85e4b81da855-4
00:41:56.816 --> 00:42:02.546
so it goes through the mode and
then residential to the customer

00150816-58c3-4065-adbe-85e4b81da855-5
00:42:02.546 --> 00:42:04.749
direct like FedEx or LTL.

23f2c989-6511-4ed4-adad-44ae85d8d7bf-0
00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.560
I think those would be all the
ones that.

bfca38bc-b59f-409e-a3fc-cb20c3697e67-0
00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:12.470
I mean and then inside that you
know are different service

bfca38bc-b59f-409e-a3fc-cb20c3697e67-1
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:15.703
levels, you know, so it could be
residential, but they do want,

bfca38bc-b59f-409e-a3fc-cb20c3697e67-2
00:42:15.703 --> 00:42:18.684
you know, white gloves that
would be the national and then

bfca38bc-b59f-409e-a3fc-cb20c3697e67-3
00:42:18.684 --> 00:42:21.765
if they just want drop ship it
would be residential but drop

bfca38bc-b59f-409e-a3fc-cb20c3697e67-4
00:42:21.765 --> 00:42:22.170
ship so.

bf7d1a00-e3fd-4da9-837e-95a997f10494-0
00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:23.450
2.

b0c63172-cb88-440c-8e93-36ab2d3f1429-0
00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:25.090
OK.

45a28a9f-f1ff-4c04-be64-6138af88241c-0
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.870
Awesome.

21e18321-760d-4e44-afe4-736c8ba58622-0
00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:32.790
Um.

de1cb498-fe0b-42e9-8c41-00cd2042fd3b-0
00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:45.307
For current error, is everyone
good with the shipment of the

de1cb498-fe0b-42e9-8c41-00cd2042fd3b-1
00:42:45.307 --> 00:42:48.580
shipment address on the purchase
order SCT?

cf158bba-4647-4000-a084-fdc931d4b17c-0
00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:51.320
Yes.

d6b1b032-a06c-4f9a-a84b-ba72cd6d1706-0
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:53.920
OK, um.

a71d8c29-752c-4271-b168-85cf450495bc-0
00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:57.960
In.

730d3b62-f302-4ddd-98ff-85e3f865b057-0
00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:03.353
The current state. Now, how do
people that uh figure out

730d3b62-f302-4ddd-98ff-85e3f865b057-1
00:43:03.353 --> 00:43:08.510
whether the item can be put on a
purchase order or put on an SCT?

1ab61cc0-6573-411d-894c-6cb6b81825e2-0
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:12.170
Is based off the stock code.

bd48f8c5-84fb-4e64-8d65-4191a81966ef-0
00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:17.543
The stock code and they're just
looking at the inventory for

bd48f8c5-84fb-4e64-8d65-4191a81966ef-1
00:43:17.543 --> 00:43:22.121
them based off this. This store
system technically does it for

bd48f8c5-84fb-4e64-8d65-4191a81966ef-2
00:43:22.121 --> 00:43:22.340
us.

85168fdd-fca5-44b4-8e2e-d32be2974318-0
00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:23.470
OK.

dc312e8c-316c-41bb-8277-118c4a50e1df-0
00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.280
Um.

3fab0955-115f-477a-8266-b49620c02430-0
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.620
Is there any outside of the
address?

2c086505-15f5-404e-87a0-54e88068b23c-0
00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.930
Topic that we just discussed? Is
there any specific details?

468abeb6-dbfd-4557-a424-871c292a5b9c-0
00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:41.550
That need to go into the
purchase order or Scott?

de72a040-bb0d-48e8-ac92-b46494f20c26-0
00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:47.230
Umm.

910b5aec-7c67-4177-8ecb-579a2d20dee2-0
00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.954
I mean, I can think of a big
automation, but I think that's

910b5aec-7c67-4177-8ecb-579a2d20dee2-1
00:43:50.954 --> 00:43:53.190
more our problem than it might
be your problem.

65837b59-4c4c-4902-99ea-d857d67c8a49-0
00:43:55.270 --> 00:44:01.220
So while we create the purchase
order in our internal system.

f05d9f08-e659-4c95-9318-f12c36bf2fd3-0
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:05.468
We then still have to write an
e-mail to the vendor to place

f05d9f08-e659-4c95-9318-f12c36bf2fd3-1
00:44:05.468 --> 00:44:08.050
the order with that attached
purchase order.

9ebe1405-f4e7-4bfa-9d4f-74eb1bfde8f4-0
00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.500
So I don't know if we.

d5b734c2-0f5c-4483-afbe-5f70b0c6141a-0
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:16.383
If there is a way for us to have
like once you create a purchase,

d5b734c2-0f5c-4483-afbe-5f70b0c6141a-1
00:44:16.383 --> 00:44:20.167
this is in a very perfect world.
So bear with me as I talk

d5b734c2-0f5c-4483-afbe-5f70b0c6141a-2
00:44:20.167 --> 00:44:23.887
through this. You create the
purchase order and you go to

d5b734c2-0f5c-4483-afbe-5f70b0c6141a-3
00:44:23.887 --> 00:44:27.864
print and automatic e-mail pops
up for you to push send to go

d5b734c2-0f5c-4483-afbe-5f70b0c6141a-4
00:44:27.864 --> 00:44:31.777
directly to that vendor versus
it just kind of living in our

d5b734c2-0f5c-4483-afbe-5f70b0c6141a-5
00:44:31.777 --> 00:44:33.830
system and our world over there.

66763324-729d-474e-9e54-81292d72117f-0
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:39.953
I don't know if we have to log
this particular based on like AL

66763324-729d-474e-9e54-81292d72117f-1
00:44:39.953 --> 00:44:42.710
would be all state and so we
have the.

31f719ee-eb39-4315-9e5b-b98c32b771f4-0
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:50.396
We never order Allstate for
source that example two Chi TU,

31f719ee-eb39-4315-9e5b-b98c32b771f4-1
00:44:50.396 --> 00:44:52.200
so we have the Umm.

03681503-cb95-42f5-b005-ee273a9e3a80-0
00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:57.122
Automatic e-mail pop up so that
they have to send the e-mail

03681503-cb95-42f5-b005-ee273a9e3a80-1
00:44:57.122 --> 00:45:01.059
into tuchi. Just thinking new
customers or new new hires in

03681503-cb95-42f5-b005-ee273a9e3a80-2
00:45:01.059 --> 00:45:05.193
general that is a big mess. I
know I missed mine my first year

03681503-cb95-42f5-b005-ee273a9e3a80-3
00:45:05.193 --> 00:45:06.440
of working here so.

48aef39a-d4ff-44bc-9716-8e83da49b245-0
00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.108
The first three months I must
step in order because I didn't

48aef39a-d4ff-44bc-9716-8e83da49b245-1
00:45:10.108 --> 00:45:12.982
send it into the vendor. I was
like, I created it through the

48aef39a-d4ff-44bc-9716-8e83da49b245-2
00:45:12.982 --> 00:45:15.579
system. They're like for the
system doesn't talk to the

48aef39a-d4ff-44bc-9716-8e83da49b245-3
00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:18.500
vendor, Alissa. And I was like,
OK, well, I'll never make that

48aef39a-d4ff-44bc-9716-8e83da49b245-4
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:19.520
mistake again. Got it.

616d7b3a-0807-4ded-b35d-0fa1183d6c38-0
00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:24.995
So on a purchase order, yeah.
And this system? Hmm. Syspro

616d7b3a-0807-4ded-b35d-0fa1183d6c38-1
00:45:24.995 --> 00:45:28.330
kind of handles how a purchase
order is created.

0d469573-65f9-4bdb-9373-27923dc05430-0
00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:30.420
I mean.

a677b39d-6d4b-4177-aa5f-f995e7154b3e-0
00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.680
If the SKU is correct, yes, OK.

34d58459-a2bd-466a-aa18-58414eb1fba9-0
00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:38.931
If the skew is not correct,
that's where we're talking about

34d58459-a2bd-466a-aa18-58414eb1fba9-1
00:45:38.931 --> 00:45:40.020
those fill in skews.

ba9bafc3-7256-4c46-9810-5064f30eb6ff-0
00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:45.491
Until that SKU is created
through IT, for us it Umm, it

ba9bafc3-7256-4c46-9810-5064f30eb6ff-1
00:45:45.491 --> 00:45:50.762
would remain a fill in skew on
the original purchase until it

ba9bafc3-7256-4c46-9810-5064f30eb6ff-2
00:45:50.762 --> 00:45:56.034
comes through. OK, so for this
automation sake, everything is

ba9bafc3-7256-4c46-9810-5064f30eb6ff-3
00:45:56.034 --> 00:45:59.010
correct in the system right
there.

7d89cc4c-1605-42fd-b239-e5f07e57cdbe-0
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:05.288
You within the backorder review
process, you just click create

7d89cc4c-1605-42fd-b239-e5f07e57cdbe-1
00:46:05.288 --> 00:46:10.143
purchase order on the item and
it creates it within the system,

7d89cc4c-1605-42fd-b239-e5f07e57cdbe-2
00:46:10.143 --> 00:46:10.750
correct?

dd8944da-6268-4389-a067-25de57e1ca25-0
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:15.955
There's a couple tabs that you
have to do and select the price,

dd8944da-6268-4389-a067-25de57e1ca25-1
00:46:15.955 --> 00:46:18.240
but other than that, yes, it is
pretty.

38d15d27-df6b-4b2c-9768-b7bdfdc9e22c-0
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:22.197
I would say it's probably more
failproof than back order review

38d15d27-df6b-4b2c-9768-b7bdfdc9e22c-1
00:46:22.197 --> 00:46:22.340
is.

35efb03d-fc9d-4a18-94db-be11827dfe01-0
00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:29.936
OK. Um, when selecting a price,
what I know that was a question

35efb03d-fc9d-4a18-94db-be11827dfe01-1
00:46:29.936 --> 00:46:31.710
that Ben had, um.

51ef658b-e1c0-48c4-8f3f-d7ad25846605-0
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:35.140
How do y'all select the price?

54872a9f-fcd6-49ba-adcd-84077584084c-0
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:39.680
Since the spring.

f0b28fdf-b198-4fee-9fc6-0275085e1934-0
00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.300
John, do you have sister pulled
up?

8cf8e783-3e33-464d-9da8-80b2732756dc-0
00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:48.437
What, what? What do you want me
to look at? How do you select

8cf8e783-3e33-464d-9da8-80b2732756dc-1
00:46:48.437 --> 00:46:52.378
the price in? What's that field
called of how to select a price

8cf8e783-3e33-464d-9da8-80b2732756dc-2
00:46:52.378 --> 00:46:53.609
in a purchase order?

ad3db7ab-6d79-45af-a7d8-8c5517a2107f-0
00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:59.624
Play up purchase price and then
it's like you double click on it

ad3db7ab-6d79-45af-a7d8-8c5517a2107f-1
00:46:59.624 --> 00:47:03.899
and then it brings up the price
and then there's a drop down

ad3db7ab-6d79-45af-a7d8-8c5517a2107f-2
00:47:03.899 --> 00:47:07.893
that says like that's if the
skew is set up like you can

ad3db7ab-6d79-45af-a7d8-8c5517a2107f-3
00:47:07.893 --> 00:47:12.308
select like manual cut like and
then type in a manual price or

ad3db7ab-6d79-45af-a7d8-8c5517a2107f-4
00:47:12.308 --> 00:47:13.919
like purchase price or.

b97c16a6-f6c3-4453-b250-b782afee0778-0
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.400
Maybe like vendor price or
something like that, but there's

b97c16a6-f6c3-4453-b250-b782afee0778-1
00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.820
like a drop down from there.

351d1b4f-8e7e-4647-86b5-ec4cbddd7980-0
00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:22.760
OK.

97b6bb7b-f7db-4b17-a308-3d4a4c71454b-0
00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.600
Uh, before we talk about.

be436fe2-e587-426a-acef-0a0d369527f4-0
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.892
What needs to go into the
emailing the vendor? Is there

be436fe2-e587-426a-acef-0a0d369527f4-1
00:47:35.892 --> 00:47:39.406
any other selections that go
into the creating a purchase

be436fe2-e587-426a-acef-0a0d369527f4-2
00:47:39.406 --> 00:47:39.770
order?

05f894b3-a4b4-4623-a2a6-e8a86d4ab413-0
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:45.801
And the only thing was, if it
has multiple lines you just put

05f894b3-a4b4-4623-a2a6-e8a86d4ab413-1
00:47:45.801 --> 00:47:46.930
then you'd have.

76b3ebba-feaf-48fb-91fc-a1746a0724dc-0
00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:51.850
So let's say there's three SKUs
for tuchi on there. You'd create

76b3ebba-feaf-48fb-91fc-a1746a0724dc-1
00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:56.040
the purchase order originally to
generate a number and just like

76b3ebba-feaf-48fb-91fc-a1746a0724dc-2
00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:59.908
back order review, you would add
to existing purchase order

76b3ebba-feaf-48fb-91fc-a1746a0724dc-3
00:47:59.908 --> 00:48:04.034
number and you'd have to type in
that purchase order number you

76b3ebba-feaf-48fb-91fc-a1746a0724dc-4
00:48:04.034 --> 00:48:04.550
created.

205f588a-4cdf-4a93-99fb-a24c2d86cd0b-0
00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:11.390
OK. So in in a in a review back
order process.

219e5246-3b96-4b9f-856f-74a3cb3e656a-0
00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:17.619
You do it per line item in the
automation. It would do one big.

219e5246-3b96-4b9f-856f-74a3cb3e656a-1
00:48:17.619 --> 00:48:22.388
It should just do one purchase
order. If we're getting multiple

219e5246-3b96-4b9f-856f-74a3cb3e656a-2
00:48:22.388 --> 00:48:26.860
items from one vendor, yes,
correct. Then that would be it.

7ae9db01-1415-4b6f-b09e-3f670a2fb50b-0
00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:29.000
OK, um.

072c4c42-c19d-44a9-9fb6-18c677470653-0
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:35.516
So emailing or when selecting a
price, the manual price, um

072c4c42-c19d-44a9-9fb6-18c677470653-1
00:48:35.516 --> 00:48:41.023
automation wouldn't be able to
select a manual price. So the

072c4c42-c19d-44a9-9fb6-18c677470653-2
00:48:41.023 --> 00:48:46.260
question is, are the prices up
to date within the system?

6072e49c-5253-4b46-a07f-3455210c4d15-0
00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:54.910
Yes and no. So there are times
that we do have to verify

6072e49c-5253-4b46-a07f-3455210c4d15-1
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:59.215
similar to how we've done where
like a surcharge has been

6072e49c-5253-4b46-a07f-3455210c4d15-2
00:48:59.215 --> 00:49:03.742
applied or something additional
has happened or they've just

6072e49c-5253-4b46-a07f-3455210c4d15-3
00:49:03.742 --> 00:49:05.449
taken a price increase.

b713d487-43da-4033-9472-c979618431fe-0
00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:10.705
So that would fall back to the
category manager to ensure that

b713d487-43da-4033-9472-c979618431fe-1
00:49:10.705 --> 00:49:13.652
all prices and syspro are
correct, which I guess would

b713d487-43da-4033-9472-c979618431fe-2
00:49:13.652 --> 00:49:14.670
roll up to the PIM.

fd8cb519-cb25-4ab2-ad03-d0d9d8f5d550-0
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:17.930
However.

9bb46b7b-250b-41b5-b098-193b92a75cc8-0
00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.710
There are times that we do have
to override that price before we

9bb46b7b-250b-41b5-b098-193b92a75cc8-1
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:24.610
receive in that purchase order,
so.

d85aa449-9284-4b46-8744-43af8b7ab557-0
00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:27.980
OK, um.

45b0c6b4-ae23-4b73-b0c7-4a697a441858-0
00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.600
Not simple, I'm sorry.

2f3b5917-e016-4df5-9578-10786993c6ce-0
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:41.731
No. That's why we're having
these meetings, to make sure

2f3b5917-e016-4df5-9578-10786993c6ce-1
00:49:41.731 --> 00:49:45.550
everything is going as expected.
So um.

f257d06e-122e-40ac-8d03-8b3fd067109a-0
00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:52.920
For purchase orders.

063c8576-c517-444e-a336-ee4abf39e724-0
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:59.149
My first assumption would be if
a price could not be found then

063c8576-c517-444e-a336-ee4abf39e724-1
00:49:59.149 --> 00:50:03.866
the automation could not fulfill
the order and that could be

063c8576-c517-444e-a336-ee4abf39e724-2
00:50:03.866 --> 00:50:06.649
something that goes on to a
report.

301e3b8b-ebd8-4bd0-97f3-5ee46ce0f112-0
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:12.560
Is that something? Yes. OK.

c93da97d-54f8-441e-9ea2-3a691b037dd8-0
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.550
I would think yes, right one.

9b94d1ad-3ec8-49a7-a3d3-071917b447cd-0
00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:29.750
Um.

8c7ad0f7-2365-48d0-98d9-fd4d98dfee11-0
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.860
If a pry.

69ca26a6-f4dd-4215-a29a-fca442f7f3a3-0
00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:41.350
If multiple prices are within
the system.

b5b8eeb8-d87b-44bb-bebf-3c6712070ab6-0
00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:43.440
What?

2b2fcddd-3dca-4537-acc2-cc5d76e80437-0
00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:49.480
What needs to be done to know
which price to select?

906821dd-ff2f-47b1-b3c1-5d9bd7ef14d4-0
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:53.310
Um.

840e8bfe-ef9c-463d-93f0-19a10faf1dd4-0
00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:57.910
It.

ab4326c9-d2c8-4b6c-97de-e17ec96ba628-0
00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:00.360
It needs to be the.

7035d75e-bb90-4857-a1aa-13281e055167-0
00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.761
Purchase price, I mean, that
probably needs to be the

7035d75e-bb90-4857-a1aa-13281e055167-1
00:51:05.761 --> 00:51:10.000
default, but we probably need to
have our report created so that

7035d75e-bb90-4857-a1aa-13281e055167-2
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.370
that's sent to Caleb.

21b915c1-5ef0-4663-a0f3-b2d23ea68c7e-0
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:12.740
Or.

efbcd784-8f68-4e07-8eec-0a7f9927fc23-0
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:16.210
The retail inventory analyst.

24f5f653-e2f3-4dad-94cd-393fd2075696-0
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:19.570
Role to review.

c494fb45-5227-4302-91ee-955fdc1f467c-0
00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:21.360
Cost.

8508452e-1f33-41cc-ac21-dd6d804f1512-0
00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:24.050
OK, so.

054444b8-9a24-4979-bd1c-e08480217d68-0
00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:30.536
If a purchase order has been
fully created with pricing, a

054444b8-9a24-4979-bd1c-e08480217d68-1
00:51:30.536 --> 00:51:35.839
report needs to be generated to
Caleb that this purchase order

054444b8-9a24-4979-bd1c-e08480217d68-2
00:51:35.839 --> 00:51:36.850
was created.

61e1f3bd-dcbd-442f-bb9b-7727bb5467df-0
00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:38.730
Needs to be reviewed.

7e04d89b-08a3-4b32-b118-6095c547f311-0
00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:46.538
Well, yeah, if there's multiple
prices or if the prices listed

7e04d89b-08a3-4b32-b118-6095c547f311-1
00:51:46.538 --> 00:51:46.990
at 0.

9f307937-02b5-406e-9d5d-1212408f0437-0
00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:51.896
$0.00 not every single one needs
to be reviewed. Just say

9f307937-02b5-406e-9d5d-1212408f0437-1
00:51:51.896 --> 00:51:52.960
anything that's.

50a76c2a-cbb8-4cd9-aede-c10eaef003c7-0
00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.400
Has multiple pricing in it.

dca93ee5-ffb9-475b-bbc9-8e5b3ac5f2bc-0
00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:58.350
For $0.00.

c42d7806-8eac-4df3-a1e4-cca6025ba71e-0
00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:18.390


783ef9b1-d9f5-415f-b9e7-64eb3ae21c0e-0
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:23.623
OK. Any other special
interaction interactions with

783ef9b1-d9f5-415f-b9e7-64eb3ae21c0e-1
00:52:23.623 --> 00:52:24.880
purchase orders?

cecdbb31-2b6f-4fed-acb6-4aecb3078551-0
00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:28.730
Not that I can think of.

26ad7624-32d3-420a-8e15-680d0445d4e1-0
00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.690
OK. Uh, Scott?

efd94df9-bd64-4c06-b4db-e0a96b3795dd-0
00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:37.966
Is there any special
consideration outside of the

efd94df9-bd64-4c06-b4db-e0a96b3795dd-1
00:52:37.966 --> 00:52:42.440
shipment address uh that you can
think of when creating SCT?

c0af14d5-cb91-4e31-8093-f66ccf7b0939-0
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:51.126
Just insuring that where it's
going to is correct. That's the

c0af14d5-cb91-4e31-8093-f66ccf7b0939-1
00:52:51.126 --> 00:52:51.780
biggest thing.

0f4f27c1-ef61-4410-ae15-4b1ed09e398c-0
00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:57.930
Once the system knows how to
fill out and create that set.

c6598823-bdf9-4645-b1f4-515a4c8fc154-0
00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:00.290
We would need that.

27266dad-71fd-4f0b-b0d4-0fafcfa79d0f-0
00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:04.752
If it so, if we got to that
world of what Sean was talking

27266dad-71fd-4f0b-b0d4-0fafcfa79d0f-1
00:53:04.752 --> 00:53:06.510
about, where it defaults to.

ce3bdb9b-fc4d-4cc2-8a84-19bceca7b901-0
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:10.992
The three PL. or if it is a
customer address, we need to

ce3bdb9b-fc4d-4cc2-8a84-19bceca7b901-1
00:53:10.992 --> 00:53:14.720
make sure the phone number gets
added into that particular

ce3bdb9b-fc4d-4cc2-8a84-19bceca7b901-2
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.100
field.

ba5d4bf5-558e-4d70-a3f6-332502a2a844-0
00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:20.200
I would say that's probably for
an SAT. Yes, Sir.

192ba3f2-bd0b-4aae-9804-f5b1fdc0c2be-0
00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:48.760
OK.

e555496b-e65c-4b7a-99a6-8744f99581af-0
00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:57.890
Any.

c8f7b938-2171-4b84-b63f-ddeec1ae4d5a-0
00:53:58.590 --> 00:53:59.920
Any other thoughts?

425e55de-1a90-4f9f-aa62-e6d9b303574a-0
00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:03.450
On the SCT automation.

a9ebf09f-b962-4622-9bb5-adb6444225eb-0
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:14.020
Not going to go OK, great. Um.

249544eb-8760-4b13-ac5a-8441436b83ff-0
00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:23.965
Thank you for your time and I
will try and write up what we

249544eb-8760-4b13-ac5a-8441436b83ff-1
00:54:23.965 --> 00:54:28.949
discussed in this meeting into
the functional requirement

249544eb-8760-4b13-ac5a-8441436b83ff-2
00:54:28.949 --> 00:54:34.277
document and let you all know
once I've updated it and we can

249544eb-8760-4b13-ac5a-8441436b83ff-3
00:54:34.277 --> 00:54:36.340
move forward from there.

e67f2a32-b40e-4d61-9040-82fafbf31a39-0
00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:42.315
Is there any kind of follow up
meeting that will need to have

e67f2a32-b40e-4d61-9040-82fafbf31a39-1
00:54:42.315 --> 00:54:43.890
off the top of your head?

5f31eee6-18b2-4534-9519-21672d83340e-0
00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:49.680
Probably to go through the.

7e819df2-25ee-480e-81be-f4dd847d5cfb-0
00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:54.507
I guess once you talk to Ben on
the how the orders like the

7e819df2-25ee-480e-81be-f4dd847d5cfb-1
00:54:54.507 --> 00:54:58.033
address selection needs to go,
we probably need to come back

7e819df2-25ee-480e-81be-f4dd847d5cfb-2
00:54:58.033 --> 00:55:00.230
and just define what that looks
like.

15b71c9d-7367-4154-b3ad-6fc1171007d0-0
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.990
OK.

d5911874-f65b-4866-a233-dbd9eea68866-0
00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:31.080
So end of Q2 that would be?

ea79f6d6-03f0-40ba-b770-cbc514f3f1f3-0
00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:35.180
That'd be from May launch,
right? Is that correct?

2d6ef59d-9488-4782-a411-339deea7ec70-0
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:37.840
From a time period standpoint.

d0db723e-4dc3-4e1d-b93a-3c6ab336bd23-0
00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.450
Or is that more April?

11f39afd-1ae1-4963-ba73-0aa9aa1e9d03-0
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:54.084
I would have to review what end
of quarter to is specified but

11f39afd-1ae1-4963-ba73-0aa9aa1e9d03-1
00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:55.100
may sounds.

17ef18b1-5014-4538-94d8-ed904120e3cb-0
00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:57.400
Likely.

009ad76e-4760-4bff-894f-96aa7c701d0d-0
00:55:58.580 --> 00:55:58.890
Yeah.

c1069540-f885-4315-ab05-b839fdecd19c-0
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:01.210
OK, perfect,

02023ee6-b2c3-49cf-abbf-f1dbb7d3272a-0
00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:03.880
Thanks.

bf7af7a7-0e3a-4380-bbd0-dcd070727c4f-0
