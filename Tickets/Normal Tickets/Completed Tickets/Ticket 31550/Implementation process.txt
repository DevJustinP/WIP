Implementation Plan:

Theory:
	Talend takes about 45 min on normal amount of data being transmitted but for files that are larger the process takes a longer time. 
	Example:
		\\sql08\p\SSIS\Data\Datafeed\SugarCRM\Completed2022_07_28 06_01_07SugarCustomerExport_20220728T060003.csv
		The above file is 24,604kb while a normal SugarCustomerExport.csv is about <10kb. This is caused by how the process of determining changes to send to sugar.
		We can look at the log file: \\sql08\p\SSIS\Data\Datafeed\SugarCRM\Logs2022_07_28_06_01_07_logs_Accounts.csv
		From the two lines that the log contains it started at 6:01:07 and finished around 6:57:37 about 56minutes of processing.
		A normal time for processing is about 0seconds for no data or 20seconds for a file 20kb.

Steps:
	1) Disable the SugarCRM Agent job.
		This will stop files being created.
	2) Once the Talend job has finished processing the files in the Active directory we can turn back on the SugarCRM Agent job.
