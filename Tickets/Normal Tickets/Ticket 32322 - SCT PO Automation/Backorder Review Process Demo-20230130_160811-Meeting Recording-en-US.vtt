3b85fd60-22fe-456c-a9a4-78a4f65b394e-0
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.553
Together, because I do not have
a good detailed outline of the

3b85fd60-22fe-456c-a9a4-78a4f65b394e-1
00:00:08.553 --> 00:00:14.546
current state for Becker order
review that that's the name for

3b85fd60-22fe-456c-a9a4-78a4f65b394e-2
00:00:14.546 --> 00:00:19.968
the process per se, to order
Scotts and purchase orders,

3b85fd60-22fe-456c-a9a4-78a4f65b394e-3
00:00:19.968 --> 00:00:25.676
correct? Yes. OK. So I just
want, if you don't mind, Alyssa

3b85fd60-22fe-456c-a9a4-78a4f65b394e-4
00:00:25.676 --> 00:00:31.478
just walking through kind of a
demo of how a person would go

3b85fd60-22fe-456c-a9a4-78a4f65b394e-5
00:00:31.478 --> 00:00:32.239
through.

55665f66-16de-4e73-aeb8-35171b924f17-0
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.732
That process and know exactly
what Syspro does. Um, and then

55665f66-16de-4e73-aeb8-35171b924f17-1
00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:44.676
after that bearing time goes
through the current functional

55665f66-16de-4e73-aeb8-35171b924f17-2
00:00:44.676 --> 00:00:50.620
requirement document, get some
of the questions left on the

55665f66-16de-4e73-aeb8-35171b924f17-3
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.662
document answered or schedule
necessary meetings afterwards.

55665f66-16de-4e73-aeb8-35171b924f17-4
00:00:56.662 --> 00:00:56.960
OK.

39aa4b68-2ea9-49d4-b8b7-65dedb026500-0
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.714
So for today's sake, do you want
me to just do a fake order to

39aa4b68-2ea9-49d4-b8b7-65dedb026500-1
00:01:02.714 --> 00:01:06.842
walk through how that would
actually happen? I don't have a

39aa4b68-2ea9-49d4-b8b7-65dedb026500-2
00:01:06.842 --> 00:01:09.250
live order for that would be
fine.

b18b1a8b-4e49-42ff-8a19-0224e9266229-0
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.350
I won't be process one.

16a8eabf-8d88-4dae-bd13-bf34b290a08b-0
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.814
Go through the screens and then
um, any talking points of

16a8eabf-8d88-4dae-bd13-bf34b290a08b-1
00:01:18.814 --> 00:01:22.760
situations that may or may not
occur through.

f025daf9-1889-4a41-8224-344cddd0343d-0
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.170
An order? Sure you have access
to the dev environment, Alyssa.

8eb616b7-7735-4f6a-8c57-3b05615d5ddd-0
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.150
I don't know if I do.

91ae8464-021b-4484-912a-4abe3a8b8d14-0
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.830
Is there a certain password that
I need to type in?

67afa8ae-5724-428e-a1b4-3c1db96c5ee3-0
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.530
It's a different.

e34e30a5-c67b-4d3f-b6bd-ed440717669f-0
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.638
Machine you'd have to connect
to. Don't think we want you to

e34e30a5-c67b-4d3f-b6bd-ed440717669f-1
00:01:41.638 --> 00:01:45.001
do this in production because
it'll force the phone numbers

e34e30a5-c67b-4d3f-b6bd-ed440717669f-2
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:46.290
creating some bad data.

9266135a-3955-4ed7-a39b-943a4331f176-0
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.830
Umm.

6c1e8611-2158-4880-97b3-529411a9b89d-0
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.870
Do you want Justin? Do you want
me to pull up?

9818b824-a2e2-409e-aeb3-bcef53dfcb81-0
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.770
Dev and she can talk us through
one and I'll do the clicking.

cc08ee8b-e7ef-4c2e-a6ba-d311ce77c401-0
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.340
If y'all two are comfortable.

99054e45-f600-4692-882c-22691807d8ad-0
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.300
Sure.

c70dbfd4-7e47-485a-a96e-3d0b7cf2461e-0
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.740
Doing that.

ae491ead-22ca-4f86-b85c-1d248fb1171a-0
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.780


e8952166-7ec8-44ae-a81c-0ff320b27c06-0
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.657
So what's the module program
that you clicked on? It just

e8952166-7ec8-44ae-a81c-0ff320b27c06-1
00:03:15.657 --> 00:03:18.690
called sales order back order
review.

d25501b2-d4bf-4490-8831-c7f4cb1a9259-0
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.970
Or just back order review and
the menu, but it's.

98e85bc0-5441-4cd6-b884-963a415b14ec-0
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.660
Under sales order processing.

8326f122-3b29-44d2-b915-ef8fbe1d2bd0-0
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.340
Yeah.

34d048c7-b3cf-4008-89ef-341f0ede6be2-0
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.794
So I'm just going to do for the
showroom works that should

34d048c7-b3cf-4008-89ef-341f0ede6be2-1
00:03:36.794 --> 00:03:38.780
should pull back multiple
orders.

9a2f02d2-6ffd-4263-b43a-2d70a55e008e-0
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.361
And we typically can do it from
a single order lens as well if

9a2f02d2-6ffd-4263-b43a-2d70a55e008e-1
00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:48.430
we would like to.

69f3c1f2-806c-4ab5-aa55-74d3457375fb-0
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.693
But just to pull up orders, this
will be able to see everything

69f3c1f2-806c-4ab5-aa55-74d3457375fb-1
00:03:52.693 --> 00:03:53.030
at once.

e04be42a-8945-4fe4-a555-4c664f700672-0
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.943
A general user would just look
through everything and start

e04be42a-8945-4fe4-a555-4c664f700672-1
00:03:58.943 --> 00:04:03.203
going at it. Um. So from a store
manager or assistant manager

e04be42a-8945-4fe4-a555-4c664f700672-2
00:04:03.203 --> 00:04:07.463
perspective you would actually
instead of using the warehouse

e04be42a-8945-4fe4-a555-4c664f700672-3
00:04:07.463 --> 00:04:11.243
functionality, you would
actually use the sales order,

e04be42a-8945-4fe4-a555-4c664f700672-4
00:04:11.243 --> 00:04:15.709
which is the lens right below it
and do it in a single capacity.

74cca702-3659-4e62-920a-29b4f6c0e998-0
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.940
And you can type in that
individual cells order number.

7b628d2f-f96b-459e-8c50-4312f738489f-0
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.982
So just to make sure I interpret
what you're saying, you all

7b628d2f-f96b-459e-8c50-4312f738489f-1
00:04:27.982 --> 00:04:31.922
would have specific sales orders
to process at a given time every

7b628d2f-f96b-459e-8c50-4312f738489f-2
00:04:31.922 --> 00:04:35.445
single day. Yes, Sir. OK. And
each number will be uniquely

7b628d2f-f96b-459e-8c50-4312f738489f-3
00:04:35.445 --> 00:04:36.579
identified as well?

83d418e5-4d3a-4866-af1c-6ac51b05a88e-0
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.620
OK.

32d57aed-c9fa-4470-8879-f874b29c8587-0
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.190
Uh, these sales orders that have
been identified, um.

924a743c-152a-45b9-b152-fdc22f8a2155-0
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.356
These are in a certain status
and uh release status has a

924a743c-152a-45b9-b152-fdc22f8a2155-1
00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:54.238
deposit on them given certain
criteria or what are these

924a743c-152a-45b9-b152-fdc22f8a2155-2
00:04:54.238 --> 00:04:59.633
criterias that the sales order
are released to start doing the

924a743c-152a-45b9-b152-fdc22f8a2155-3
00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:04.257
back order review. So from a
retail perspective it is

924a743c-152a-45b9-b152-fdc22f8a2155-4
00:05:04.257 --> 00:05:08.967
different than a wholesale or
contract perspective. So

924a743c-152a-45b9-b152-fdc22f8a2155-5
00:05:08.967 --> 00:05:14.620
customer or in consumer comes in
that day they place their order.

0ed6a5fc-815b-479a-b213-fc14b3990b13-0
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.414
Through Ecat, Ecat will give us
a uniquely identified number

0ed6a5fc-815b-479a-b213-fc14b3990b13-1
00:05:19.414 --> 00:05:24.205
that Ben typed in the individual
cells order lens line in the

0ed6a5fc-815b-479a-b213-fc14b3990b13-2
00:05:24.205 --> 00:05:28.996
single and that will give all of
the, Umm uniquely identified

0ed6a5fc-815b-479a-b213-fc14b3990b13-3
00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:33.942
stock code numbers unless it is
a special order from a purchase

0ed6a5fc-815b-479a-b213-fc14b3990b13-4
00:05:33.942 --> 00:05:38.656
order side of the business,
which there are some examples. I

0ed6a5fc-815b-479a-b213-fc14b3990b13-5
00:05:38.656 --> 00:05:43.602
saw treasure garden in there as
well that we'll use in a second

0ed6a5fc-815b-479a-b213-fc14b3990b13-6
00:05:43.602 --> 00:05:45.379
so these are specified.

399e66bc-d548-49c6-a6bc-8222af3a862c-0
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.645
To that particular customer, how
we qualify them to go directly

399e66bc-d548-49c6-a6bc-8222af3a862c-1
00:05:49.645 --> 00:05:53.644
to, I just have to have a 50%
deposit down that day to place

399e66bc-d548-49c6-a6bc-8222af3a862c-2
00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:54.300
the order.

bba8ca80-e941-446d-9bfe-d8b689286ba5-0
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.010
OK. No, they're all customers.

321d0a72-00a4-44ee-9ed4-b8a9bca7e1d8-0
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.686
Do deposits or do you all do
terms for any of your like

321d0a72-00a4-44ee-9ed4-b8a9bca7e1d8-1
00:06:02.686 --> 00:06:07.266
designers or no terms everybody
is deposits or paid in full and

321d0a72-00a4-44ee-9ed4-b8a9bca7e1d8-2
00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:07.910
the only.

440773ae-14db-4e30-92ba-c4b8bc6bf2f8-0
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.760
Potential what you and I
wouldn't even call it a term is

440773ae-14db-4e30-92ba-c4b8bc6bf2f8-1
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.730
when we do the financing like
the Wells Fargo financing and

440773ae-14db-4e30-92ba-c4b8bc6bf2f8-2
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.699
they'll do a 15% down payment
deposit and then the residual

440773ae-14db-4e30-92ba-c4b8bc6bf2f8-3
00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.279
will go through Wells Fargo
financing.

f7344466-2051-4450-9f80-d35200f0c248-0
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.995
But other than that, it's 50%
down or 100% down, whichever way

f7344466-2051-4450-9f80-d35200f0c248-1
00:06:28.995 --> 00:06:31.040
the customer would like to pay.

c72c5706-29b2-4b47-9818-7e0d0c256360-0
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.930
Yeah.

2d88a914-371e-4b49-b758-cf246ae7c0e8-0
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.196
OK, so to start the process, we
go into back order review. We'll

2d88a914-371e-4b49-b758-cf246ae7c0e8-1
00:06:44.196 --> 00:06:46.370
double click on the first line.

952aed36-8ae5-41a9-87f0-e5a60ce2bd7e-0
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.457
Um here will determine which
particular warehouse. If it's

952aed36-8ae5-41a9-87f0-e5a60ce2bd7e-1
00:06:52.457 --> 00:06:55.932
going to be a SCT, which would
be which would be the supply

952aed36-8ae5-41a9-87f0-e5a60ce2bd7e-2
00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:59.581
chain transfer, or based on the
stock code if it is actually a

952aed36-8ae5-41a9-87f0-e5a60ce2bd7e-3
00:06:59.581 --> 00:07:03.056
purchase order, so it will
default based on the stock code.

952aed36-8ae5-41a9-87f0-e5a60ce2bd7e-4
00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:06.531
This one's going to default as
an SCT since we're doing all

952aed36-8ae5-41a9-87f0-e5a60ce2bd7e-5
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:08.790
summer classics and we'll push
accept.

7a70f323-dfc7-4178-9044-f1514d14af0e-0
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.556
And then this box will pop up
where it will actually do the

7a70f323-dfc7-4178-9044-f1514d14af0e-1
00:07:18.556 --> 00:07:22.175
source warehouse, again based
off of stock code which is going

7a70f323-dfc7-4178-9044-f1514d14af0e-2
00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:22.980
to go to main.

2aeb4623-1fd6-4f87-bce2-f42fbf2cd2f5-0
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.860
So once we're in this particular
piece, there's only two fields

2aeb4623-1fd6-4f87-bce2-f42fbf2cd2f5-1
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.572
that we fill out in this
particular lens, which is the

2aeb4623-1fd6-4f87-bce2-f42fbf2cd2f5-2
00:07:32.572 --> 00:07:33.990
special instructions.

6ac591ba-829b-4f4a-932f-f15dbc490cc8-0
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.221
Which would be the special
instructions would be, is it

6ac591ba-829b-4f4a-932f-f15dbc490cc8-1
00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:51.620
going to be a pick up, a
delivery or a white glove out of

6ac591ba-829b-4f4a-932f-f15dbc490cc8-2
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.020
area, just depending on the
three different ways we ship.

01609b17-0156-4073-afd6-a044b14be2ef-0
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.390
And then the ship via code would
be the next one.

a0b13775-d84d-4cfe-97dc-e999927de17f-0
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.321
Where we would either select if
it's going to be a full

a0b13775-d84d-4cfe-97dc-e999927de17f-1
00:08:05.321 --> 00:08:09.350
truckload that we ship out every
single week, we would do the SD

a0b13775-d84d-4cfe-97dc-e999927de17f-2
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.131
truck load or if it's going to
drop ship to the customer, we

a0b13775-d84d-4cfe-97dc-e999927de17f-3
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:16.850
would do the prepaid freight
because the customer pays that

a0b13775-d84d-4cfe-97dc-e999927de17f-4
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.090
at time of purchase.

9d35cbf2-dea6-4d51-867f-83cf6bae12cf-0
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:27.311
And then the only other thing to
notate is if we do select

9d35cbf2-dea6-4d51-867f-83cf6bae12cf-1
00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:31.501
prepaid freight, we do have to
change the address to the in

9d35cbf2-dea6-4d51-867f-83cf6bae12cf-2
00:08:31.501 --> 00:08:35.273
consumers home, otherwise it
will default to the full

9d35cbf2-dea6-4d51-867f-83cf6bae12cf-3
00:08:35.273 --> 00:08:37.020
truckload delivery route.

a4763cb2-57cd-4472-b3b8-1ad8b0f8ba74-0
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.290
No matter what.

f1d287de-393e-4cdf-85a4-2d47bffacff1-0
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:50.120
Before we get too far from this,
what indicates?

2065f3c8-994a-47be-bab9-06ac70997fff-0
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:56.275
What selections need to be made?
Is this something that you know

2065f3c8-994a-47be-bab9-06ac70997fff-1
00:08:56.275 --> 00:09:00.941
off of hand based off the
customer, or is there data in

2065f3c8-994a-47be-bab9-06ac70997fff-2
00:09:00.941 --> 00:09:05.440
syspro that can specify whether
or not these shipping

2065f3c8-994a-47be-bab9-06ac70997fff-3
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.440
instructions are needed?

b6447df0-951e-4307-a450-38f1bc3e5fb1-0
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.062
So every single order that is
placed through which I'm just

b6447df0-951e-4307-a450-38f1bc3e5fb1-1
00:09:12.062 --> 00:09:15.671
going to hold up a random sheet
of paper which you can't see,

b6447df0-951e-4307-a450-38f1bc3e5fb1-2
00:09:15.671 --> 00:09:19.455
every single order will have the
directions of how it's going to

b6447df0-951e-4307-a450-38f1bc3e5fb1-3
00:09:19.455 --> 00:09:22.656
be shipping. So every single
customer gets basically a

b6447df0-951e-4307-a450-38f1bc3e5fb1-4
00:09:22.656 --> 00:09:26.265
customer packet if you will, or
customer profile. I have this

b6447df0-951e-4307-a450-38f1bc3e5fb1-5
00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:29.525
detailed out in our office
manual, Justin, that I could

b6447df0-951e-4307-a450-38f1bc3e5fb1-6
00:09:29.525 --> 00:09:33.308
send out to you. So that way you
can kind of see what that looks

b6447df0-951e-4307-a450-38f1bc3e5fb1-7
00:09:33.308 --> 00:09:33.599
like.

2b27a108-56fa-4376-b235-93bd86e081f2-0
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.238
And it'll give those directions
of what needs to happen to go

2b27a108-56fa-4376-b235-93bd86e081f2-1
00:09:38.238 --> 00:09:38.560
where.

a69d4097-d836-43d4-a77e-03c0c8a20e8b-0
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.090
OK.

d55ea608-36b4-4d32-86d9-3de0fdb92d61-0
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.680
And then?

0a9cb5b4-d97a-4330-bff7-5dde07940aca-0
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.307
But yes, typically every single
customer has a piece of paper

0a9cb5b4-d97a-4330-bff7-5dde07940aca-1
00:09:51.307 --> 00:09:54.765
and then through ecat we
actually make the design

0a9cb5b4-d97a-4330-bff7-5dde07940aca-2
00:09:54.765 --> 00:09:56.010
consultant select.

193668f3-58ed-45a1-a746-0295a4892684-0
00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.600
Some of that information through
there too.

feede599-6dda-4052-ad9d-35286aa36637-0
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:06.204
So one question already, the
shipping has been definitely

feede599-6dda-4052-ad9d-35286aa36637-1
00:10:06.204 --> 00:10:10.798
made as an important thing that
needs to be correct. When

feede599-6dda-4052-ad9d-35286aa36637-2
00:10:10.798 --> 00:10:15.314
creating the CTS and PCOS,
something that we do get from

feede599-6dda-4052-ad9d-35286aa36637-3
00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:20.383
Ecat is shipping instructions,
does that reflect what is in the

feede599-6dda-4052-ad9d-35286aa36637-4
00:10:20.383 --> 00:10:25.453
customer packet and can we make
the specific designations based

feede599-6dda-4052-ad9d-35286aa36637-5
00:10:25.453 --> 00:10:30.206
off that information coming
over? Yes, I believe so that is

feede599-6dda-4052-ad9d-35286aa36637-6
00:10:30.206 --> 00:10:30.839
correct.

19dc2d03-5e44-4b8c-862c-3f157e330653-0
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.761
Something I will try to shoot
your way is, um, things that we

19dc2d03-5e44-4b8c-862c-3f157e330653-1
00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:38.830
see from ecat and make sure.

75572d66-f24f-4042-ae75-feb099a3bdfd-0
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.380
We make sure apples are apples
and oranges are oranges, so.

307a6f41-6f08-4f59-865b-250362b8e408-0
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.336
OK, so once we've done all this
information, we're going to go

307a6f41-6f08-4f59-865b-250362b8e408-1
00:10:50.336 --> 00:10:53.080
and push create STT. It'll ask
you want to create that.

6b6f955f-0a4f-4d81-bbf4-73603a92e3e6-0
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.160
We will print.

08f15244-fe40-406b-bb5c-e6d8b7725b58-0
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.970
Just take someone out.

2379fcea-8a62-4f86-bcc4-e72bd9304935-0
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.426
And then once this screen pops
up, it should provide you with

2379fcea-8a62-4f86-bcc4-e72bd9304935-1
00:11:37.426 --> 00:11:41.932
the order number which is the
SCT number and we have to write

2379fcea-8a62-4f86-bcc4-e72bd9304935-2
00:11:41.932 --> 00:11:45.930
that number down to make sure
the next two additional.

fec0396d-1203-4a6e-8d96-4dd5a2e5363e-0
00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.683
Order numbers will or two
additional line items go on that

fec0396d-1203-4a6e-8d96-4dd5a2e5363e-1
00:11:51.683 --> 00:11:55.107
exact order. So we're not
creating multiple individual

fec0396d-1203-4a6e-8d96-4dd5a2e5363e-2
00:11:55.107 --> 00:11:55.729
shipments.

b293b548-227b-4ed2-b6d3-21981175d784-0
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.623
Are those order acknowledgements
being printed or are those just

b293b548-227b-4ed2-b6d3-21981175d784-1
00:12:03.623 --> 00:12:07.803
you're basically just building
this huge customer packet? It's

b293b548-227b-4ed2-b6d3-21981175d784-2
00:12:07.803 --> 00:12:11.520
not very green by any means, but
yes, it is 100% there.

13130e32-78cd-4d0e-bfe4-caf31b2a3335-0
00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:18.486
The Prince is necessary, or is
that something that we can

13130e32-78cd-4d0e-bfe4-caf31b2a3335-1
00:12:18.486 --> 00:12:20.280
design a different?

59f0a7db-b5cc-4d5d-85a3-c733c3b46d74-0
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.620
Uh, process for.

5582ce16-f772-414a-81f5-d5f2206aa973-0
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.206
As long as I can have it linked
back up to that 301 number, I'm

5582ce16-f772-414a-81f5-d5f2206aa973-1
00:12:27.206 --> 00:12:30.517
OK with. However, if you want to
design it a different way, I

5582ce16-f772-414a-81f5-d5f2206aa973-2
00:12:30.517 --> 00:12:33.240
just need to know that those two
connect together.

7b704e1a-0c96-4651-b729-e026839c0bff-0
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.120
Is it? That's just definitely
something.

fa5fde35-f327-4dc8-8fd1-0ec5321925eb-0
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:45.230
Through the automation that it
could be lost, so correct.

8bf1164a-1961-447d-98a8-2f5a7ae77919-0
00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:51.149
So then you'll go back, double
click on the next line has been

8bf1164a-1961-447d-98a8-2f5a7ae77919-1
00:12:51.149 --> 00:12:54.929
has it defaults to that
warehouse and then down at the

8bf1164a-1961-447d-98a8-2f5a7ae77919-2
00:12:54.929 --> 00:12:58.160
bottom we check mark that add to
existing SCT.

7e64ff4f-9f8b-4b3e-a470-f0b005a7a307-0
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.495
And then type in that supply
chain transfer number. So that

7e64ff4f-9f8b-4b3e-a470-f0b005a7a307-1
00:13:02.495 --> 00:13:05.668
way they're all coordinating
together and you're just

7e64ff4f-9f8b-4b3e-a470-f0b005a7a307-2
00:13:05.668 --> 00:13:08.900
basically building that
information up until you're at

7e64ff4f-9f8b-4b3e-a470-f0b005a7a307-3
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.073
the very end and that's
typically when I print it, is

7e64ff4f-9f8b-4b3e-a470-f0b005a7a307-4
00:13:12.073 --> 00:13:15.364
that the very end. So that way
all three lines would be

7e64ff4f-9f8b-4b3e-a470-f0b005a7a307-5
00:13:15.364 --> 00:13:17.009
showcased on that one order.

a75d908f-247c-4717-9fb4-8cbb1655053d-0
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:18.340
OK.

e9798c19-37aa-40cf-8ee6-7d8f8976e7dd-0
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.230
Will follow the same thing.

536bba5f-0383-497c-a631-5e8089ecd950-0
00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:47.167
OK. And then from there, that is
all the back order review

536bba5f-0383-497c-a631-5e8089ecd950-1
00:13:47.167 --> 00:13:51.036
processes. It's pretty
simplistic. However, there is

536bba5f-0383-497c-a631-5e8089ecd950-2
00:13:51.036 --> 00:13:55.708
one additional step that has to
happen, so we exit a back order

536bba5f-0383-497c-a631-5e8089ecd950-3
00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:56.220
review.

22eef6ed-5f3d-48bc-84c4-c47c2500df05-0
00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.890
And then we go back into sales
order entry.

4a77e5c5-aa2e-49ae-9c71-d24c95043fe0-0
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.490
This is where automation can
help us tremendously.

8a7c31c2-eab4-4197-8f45-99e4353a24f2-0
00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.110
Umm.

4cc5d051-d039-4382-b12e-5a348920028a-0
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.772
We got a function order
maintenance type in that 100

4cc5d051-d039-4382-b12e-5a348920028a-1
00:14:14.772 --> 00:14:15.210
number.

05614285-e8dd-4845-ada5-64f5238312dd-0
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.470
Y'all are manually entering the
SCT for the line items on the

05614285-e8dd-4845-ada5-64f5238312dd-1
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:23.910
sales order. Awesome.

44b7fbe3-f60e-4ade-b497-a8ce763bac78-0
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.170
OK.

f950a61d-9d45-4bb9-b9d5-b172bedabe62-0
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.540
So if you look here on the
screen, it will show the three

f950a61d-9d45-4bb9-b9d5-b172bedabe62-1
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:34.742
line items that we initially put
onto the order through the back

f950a61d-9d45-4bb9-b9d5-b172bedabe62-2
00:14:34.742 --> 00:14:38.298
order review process. But then
I've already filled out

f950a61d-9d45-4bb9-b9d5-b172bedabe62-3
00:14:38.298 --> 00:14:42.048
everything in this order header
on the 300 side. All that

f950a61d-9d45-4bb9-b9d5-b172bedabe62-4
00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:45.863
information correlated to the
100. Then I wouldn't have to

f950a61d-9d45-4bb9-b9d5-b172bedabe62-5
00:14:45.863 --> 00:14:49.290
dedupe. Right now we have to
double type everything.

49798195-3b4a-42b6-a981-a7f6a53b81b9-0
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:50.740
OK.

4c17b2da-13ac-452b-bc3c-40d30cecc258-0
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.278
And I have this all detailed out
in the office manual as well

4c17b2da-13ac-452b-bc3c-40d30cecc258-1
00:14:54.278 --> 00:14:56.840
what has to be filled out, but I
can walk you through it.

bb713187-60b1-449c-bf4a-eef2abdd67c1-0
00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.721
I appreciate it. So on the
customer purchase order line

bb713187-60b1-449c-bf4a-eef2abdd67c1-1
00:15:01.721 --> 00:15:06.121
number and that's the customer's
first name, last name and the

bb713187-60b1-449c-bf4a-eef2abdd67c1-2
00:15:06.121 --> 00:15:06.890
301 number.

2a2c13b7-8d30-4181-a327-203b5c1320e3-0
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:13.170
The next line item is promo
code.

22492a1a-44b8-4236-b2e4-43ad70fe7d0d-0
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.009
And then that we use the
magnifying glass and put none

22492a1a-44b8-4236-b2e4-43ad70fe7d0d-1
00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:34.480
always.

b6371da6-bb55-4e3d-8dca-cb945178ea70-0
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.540
The next one is the customer Rep
so we always default to

b6371da6-bb55-4e3d-8dca-cb945178ea70-1
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.220
customer.

e6b441d1-56c1-4550-8708-1409b9e98372-0
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.008
Unless it's a store order, then
it'll go to management or

e6b441d1-56c1-4550-8708-1409b9e98372-1
00:15:47.008 --> 00:15:47.400
visual.

c076cd28-b0d0-417f-9232-20e6e77a7dd1-0
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.704
Umm, sorry Ben, yours looks a
little different than my desk,

c076cd28-b0d0-417f-9232-20e6e77a7dd1-1
00:15:52.704 --> 00:15:54.830
so I'm like, OK, hang on, you're
fine.

d4505bf0-ae22-4b90-8f53-0a6d0a38b50b-0
00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.069
See, I don't have any code blue,
so we won't mess with that

d4505bf0-ae22-4b90-8f53-0a6d0a38b50b-1
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:03.921
delivery phone number. That's a
must that I have to have for

d4505bf0-ae22-4b90-8f53-0a6d0a38b50b-2
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:04.490
shipping.

e50de99a-6647-4b56-9220-a5bf1f0a1742-0
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.861
What's the delivery phone number
that needs to be entered there?

e50de99a-6647-4b56-9220-a5bf1f0a1742-1
00:16:16.861 --> 00:16:20.283
That is the end. That's either
the third party logistics

e50de99a-6647-4b56-9220-a5bf1f0a1742-2
00:16:20.283 --> 00:16:24.185
company number. So that way they
have a number to call or if I'm

e50de99a-6647-4b56-9220-a5bf1f0a1742-3
00:16:24.185 --> 00:16:28.027
drop shipping it to the customer
that's where FedEx, UPS or the

e50de99a-6647-4b56-9220-a5bf1f0a1742-4
00:16:28.027 --> 00:16:31.809
White Glove agent would have a
phone number to call and set up

e50de99a-6647-4b56-9220-a5bf1f0a1742-5
00:16:31.809 --> 00:16:32.590
the delivery.

f998ee43-775e-4a39-ad8b-65104c681ed7-0
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:39.640
Um, OK, so then delivery type?

dc87d165-dc85-4fb1-a14f-2c8d5a7edd2c-0
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.781
This is actually pre selected
through ecat in general, so this

dc87d165-dc85-4fb1-a14f-2c8d5a7edd2c-1
00:16:45.781 --> 00:16:49.116
information could tie over
directly to you. But right now

dc87d165-dc85-4fb1-a14f-2c8d5a7edd2c-2
00:16:49.116 --> 00:16:52.507
we manually do see you can
select standard or white glove.

dc87d165-dc85-4fb1-a14f-2c8d5a7edd2c-3
00:16:52.507 --> 00:16:54.980
Those are the only two services
in retail.

43f13a73-d6e0-430f-8bc1-a7a0c27a404b-0
00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.270
Address type, but if it's
shipping to your three PL. even

43f13a73-d6e0-430f-8bc1-a7a0c27a404b-1
00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.880
though the order might be white
glove.

3c7018a3-36b3-4c74-bd8e-1c8596171aec-0
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:05.840
100 correct.

4012faac-db85-430b-b9aa-88c449174408-0
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.788
Correct. I usually put the
address type or would be

4012faac-db85-430b-b9aa-88c449174408-1
00:17:10.788 --> 00:17:13.510
residential, that would be
commercial.

214c3109-e711-4e12-bd74-4d58dcc2efd7-0
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.166
And then shipment requests we
put complete on everything

214c3109-e711-4e12-bd74-4d58dcc2efd7-1
00:17:28.166 --> 00:17:30.950
unless we're split shipping an
order.

21edc81d-2c99-4ccd-848e-03de30cefbc0-0
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.707
It will already have that
customers information in because

21edc81d-2c99-4ccd-848e-03de30cefbc0-1
00:17:35.707 --> 00:17:38.889
we did that through back order
review and that's all we do in

21edc81d-2c99-4ccd-848e-03de30cefbc0-2
00:17:38.889 --> 00:17:40.070
that particular screen.

98ad896d-82ab-4c78-b24e-7f0580905103-0
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.370
So each order probably takes you
about.

a202f334-c4b4-424b-98d3-8b7240ff63dd-0
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.380
10 minutes, 5 to 10 minutes to
process.

27ef8bc2-7909-4d45-a94e-1412fdca45c4-0
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.460
As you go through all the
different steps and then when

27ef8bc2-7909-4d45-a94e-1412fdca45c4-1
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.680
they start comingling like where
you sell.

4736e067-f414-434d-bda4-a080363cbae3-0
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:04.138
Summer classics, Gabby and then
a special order vendor. Those

4736e067-f414-434d-bda4-a080363cbae3-1
00:18:04.138 --> 00:18:06.620
could take up to 30 minutes in
order.

9898d457-af92-4813-ad66-2ab2b44fb367-0
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:08.720
OK.

0dca0894-67aa-4189-b99f-5efa2c161d2a-0
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.950
And here's an example of one
that would get.

f0037e89-3f33-462b-a255-b7b9c80e2890-0
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.710
Two SCT's because these items
come from different warehouses.

d7c09df7-d431-42d4-bc44-90ac56e88f90-0
00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.670
Yeah, correct.

41cf84ae-847f-4f7f-bf42-cc2a8af72f02-0
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:57.532
So this item will get SCT from
MSN and this one will get an SCT

41cf84ae-847f-4f7f-bf42-cc2a8af72f02-1
00:18:57.532 --> 00:18:58.100
from MB.

489714a6-9d34-4dbf-838c-637b746cc1f3-0
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.430
And it's my understanding right
now front.

23447f61-06bb-4daf-bf7d-d6bf1021d685-0
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.608
Excuse me, from the 301 lens,
we're already able to go by

23447f61-06bb-4daf-bf7d-d6bf1021d685-1
00:19:08.608 --> 00:19:11.430
stock code line as long as we
went through.

e500e7ba-d2d1-47d7-93b3-4b0405ca7cca-0
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.909
The back order review process,
it will tie that SCT number to

e500e7ba-d2d1-47d7-93b3-4b0405ca7cca-1
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:17.880
that line item.

44ab1bfc-a0a7-4ab0-af06-1d8d614ddfe6-0
00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:19.050
Yeah.

4668c7bb-fa71-44fe-af8f-ba08c9d131e0-0
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.240
So we would still need that
capability.

d8a636ae-da62-49fc-a1f4-1c796182351e-0
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.880
If we're eliminating STD's.

1017d6f2-5b48-467f-8a80-bc06423e05cf-0
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.320
Into automation.

168dde1b-ac58-4625-b9cc-8e5ca47c98d8-0
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:41.220
Or in this one you would have an
SCT and a purchase order.

c755b698-0852-4876-9c04-edb2312726a9-0
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.110
Correct.

d8a015d3-cd03-43f4-a710-69889f5d1e86-0
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:50.030
Is the purchase order pretty or
somewhat similar in creating?

98f89216-df2f-4a85-9d49-6d75c613d2f1-0
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:57.664
Well, that particular vendor,
there's only 7 vendors we're

98f89216-df2f-4a85-9d49-6d75c613d2f1-1
00:19:57.664 --> 00:20:00.530
allowed to order from that
particular.

2a8a3cb4-4f48-424e-8efd-16bd36359317-0
00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.480
Um piece would be something they
sold off at their floor.

8d191b4a-92d8-493d-9220-ec6a9b300b11-0
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:06.940
OK.

07179612-d9f0-4f49-bfb3-759c5371ab70-0
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.743
And I can provide you those
seven vendors that would be

07179612-d9f0-4f49-bfb3-759c5371ab70-1
00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:14.993
special order capability for my
purchase order lens if you'd

07179612-d9f0-4f49-bfb3-759c5371ab70-2
00:20:14.993 --> 00:20:15.580
like us to.

f3758ff5-1dac-4445-b87d-166cfd5b47ba-0
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.460
That would be beneficial, OK.

94791da5-3268-457f-848c-1d8be75b73af-0
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.745
Wouldn't that be allocated
though if they sold it off their

94791da5-3268-457f-848c-1d8be75b73af-1
00:20:27.745 --> 00:20:28.970
floor and not backordered?

094a4866-c883-44a4-9193-b09c58ac4d3b-0
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.850
It could.

04537de9-ad40-49e8-9fca-9d4f817a2056-0
00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.320
It should be.

eb9d06b8-5f51-45cc-952a-029025681fbc-0
00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.700
Unless they haven't received
that purchase order in yet.

1c14d185-7248-4cf6-9b1f-434fcc91b642-0
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:38.400
Gotcha.

a594806c-8fa3-405c-b78b-66d1e22d0d97-0
00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:49.224
So even on those seven vendors
you could have which we will

a594806c-8fa3-405c-b78b-66d1e22d0d97-1
00:20:49.224 --> 00:20:52.471
have a line item, we'll have
that line item flagged for this

a594806c-8fa3-405c-b78b-66d1e22d0d97-2
00:20:52.471 --> 00:20:55.240
special order or not. So I guess
it doesn't matter.

91f8524b-c31e-4d74-97ff-d9929960e4ff-0
00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.020
But yeah, the PO process is
pretty similar.

8f0b1b44-58b8-4a9c-9193-b3208162cf0c-0
00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.380
Umm.

79456ecd-5de7-44f1-bb8d-12f63e25eea8-0
00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.720
You can pick the customer's
address.

b8fbce99-2160-48e6-9543-ef40eab76fac-0
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.250
Right.

3b96ba8b-ff02-4888-92b5-1362d7d8265d-0
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.660
The trickier part on PO's I
would say would be.

7f0876a4-3ea5-43a4-86a3-3a51c6061b95-0
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.740
Picking the right pricing
potentially if you had an item

7f0876a4-3ea5-43a4-86a3-3a51c6061b95-1
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.300
with multiple price tiers.

7e6801e5-c500-4b5c-8deb-544e616c59fa-0
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:26.980
Um.

62862b00-df72-4654-93f1-92e076937ca4-0
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.880
Well, and what we've also
learned is that.

e86b6cea-3eef-424c-86be-a508a0b98ddc-0
00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.290
Umm.

054c918d-85b5-440b-906e-9e90a89cdf20-0
00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:44.218
Pricing for those vendors, it's
only updated as SKU request

054c918d-85b5-440b-906e-9e90a89cdf20-1
00:21:44.218 --> 00:21:47.790
needs are there. We don't go
back through and re update.

18205416-d7d6-4965-8956-0dc01203a30b-0
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:51.354
Every single price cut
potentially in our system, every

18205416-d7d6-4965-8956-0dc01203a30b-1
00:21:51.354 --> 00:21:54.496
single year, no would take us
millions and millions of years

18205416-d7d6-4965-8956-0dc01203a30b-2
00:21:54.496 --> 00:21:54.959
to do so.

10949445-d4fd-4b6a-b3ec-1bc3dc8c8a1d-0
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.810
So is that gonna be an issue
that the PO is going to get

10949445-d4fd-4b6a-b3ec-1bc3dc8c8a1d-1
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:05.960
created at whatever price we
have in the system?

ea020a14-ec05-469b-907c-815cad127e0d-0
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.700
As long as I can edit it.

06574711-760a-4951-80e1-db420f415211-0
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:13.629
Before we do the final receipt
of goods for Lee to pay the

06574711-760a-4951-80e1-db420f415211-1
00:22:13.629 --> 00:22:15.830
bill, I don't think it should be
an issue.

ec48122f-5086-4ec9-8ff1-dd78733f784a-0
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.180
The other thing about purchase
orders is while.

82a94909-8e0c-4e00-8d3e-d2ca2ce9e442-0
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:28.626
Umm. We are going to automate
the purchase order number to

82a94909-8e0c-4e00-8d3e-d2ca2ce9e442-1
00:22:28.626 --> 00:22:32.324
start, I still have to send a
separate e-mail to the vendors

82a94909-8e0c-4e00-8d3e-d2ca2ce9e442-2
00:22:32.324 --> 00:22:33.840
placing the actual order.

501dd840-9ed2-4543-9cf3-d9f804b789ad-0
00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.750
Just creating the purchase order
doesn't.

4d462f88-9acc-4a0a-b2c6-73e33078cee8-0
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.582
That's not the end step. The
last step is to e-mail the

4d462f88-9acc-4a0a-b2c6-73e33078cee8-1
00:22:43.582 --> 00:22:45.520
vendors directly to place the
order.

06a7ade6-db82-40d2-b972-52912ee08fad-0
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:55.357
Is this so you need to do all
manual processing to actually

06a7ade6-db82-40d2-b972-52912ee08fad-1
00:22:55.357 --> 00:23:01.107
order the purchase order? Is
that something that could go

06a7ade6-db82-40d2-b972-52912ee08fad-2
00:23:01.107 --> 00:23:06.559
into? I know we've already
talked about reporting some

06a7ade6-db82-40d2-b972-52912ee08fad-3
00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:11.019
errors when trying to automate a
back order.

57253c5d-80d8-4135-a453-a257213be5ab-0
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.490
With this.

23461853-940f-4520-96e8-c8e55b6b2fc0-0
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:20.283
Should this just simply be
reporting in general where it

23461853-940f-4520-96e8-c8e55b6b2fc0-1
00:23:20.283 --> 00:23:26.157
would list issues when trying to
process a back ordered item? Um.

23461853-940f-4520-96e8-c8e55b6b2fc0-2
00:23:26.157 --> 00:23:31.853
But also if it was successful in
creating Scott and or purchase

23461853-940f-4520-96e8-c8e55b6b2fc0-3
00:23:31.853 --> 00:23:33.989
orders it will just say.

12d469a9-775e-4f0b-bc8b-9b66fb4e8d7b-0
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:40.486
Processing this order. These
SCT's were created with these

12d469a9-775e-4f0b-bc8b-9b66fb4e8d7b-1
00:23:40.486 --> 00:23:46.408
items. This purchase order was
created with this item so that

12d469a9-775e-4f0b-bc8b-9b66fb4e8d7b-2
00:23:46.408 --> 00:23:52.236
if more manual entry is needed,
someone a user can go in and

12d469a9-775e-4f0b-bc8b-9b66fb4e8d7b-3
00:23:52.236 --> 00:23:53.860
update as needed.

e39c7ab6-9306-49fb-8701-f5a5f69d61ca-0
00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:55.750
Hmm.

b034d226-3f8a-429f-917d-12255a21859c-0
00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:02.463
For the real. So I'm going to
give my wish list here. OK well

b034d226-3f8a-429f-917d-12255a21859c-1
00:24:02.463 --> 00:24:06.897
would be really cool is that
once we create the purchase

b034d226-3f8a-429f-917d-12255a21859c-2
00:24:06.897 --> 00:24:11.254
order number or once it
automates, you almost have like

b034d226-3f8a-429f-917d-12255a21859c-3
00:24:11.254 --> 00:24:11.410
a.

54b4e0cf-e566-4c5c-a54c-e1d775c7e01a-0
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:16.452
Because we have to submit the
PDF with the actual order as

54b4e0cf-e566-4c5c-a54c-e1d775c7e01a-1
00:24:16.452 --> 00:24:19.230
well. So if the PDF almost went
into.

4b0d5d2d-e422-4e43-82d7-b38c2c7c0de2-0
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:24.572
Like it was like an actionable
item that you had to go and then

4b0d5d2d-e422-4e43-82d7-b38c2c7c0de2-1
00:24:24.572 --> 00:24:26.880
take the PDF to send to the
vendor.

990d9d47-f38d-442a-a7a1-9fe35621de42-0
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:34.764
So PDF that makes sense created,
it's just a user goes to some

990d9d47-f38d-442a-a7a1-9fe35621de42-1
00:24:34.764 --> 00:24:37.930
file location to pull that PDF
to send.

4f954787-be14-4815-9aa6-b3071bd4d24b-0
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:39.050
Correct.

4f4f810a-8d5c-4209-8470-74a8012772b1-0
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.460
Say one more time.

9cb9db31-a5e7-411d-9d5c-e8c85ae186a5-0
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:49.609
So automation creates the
purchase order, yes? Through the

9cb9db31-a5e7-411d-9d5c-e8c85ae186a5-1
00:24:49.609 --> 00:24:54.979
automation. Your wish list would
be after the purchase order is

9cb9db31-a5e7-411d-9d5c-e8c85ae186a5-2
00:24:54.979 --> 00:25:00.012
created to create said PDF to
send to the vendor and I use.

9cb9db31-a5e7-411d-9d5c-e8c85ae186a5-3
00:25:00.012 --> 00:25:05.549
All the user would have to do is
go to that file location to pick

9cb9db31-a5e7-411d-9d5c-e8c85ae186a5-4
00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:07.060
it up and send it.

d41f7230-ae6e-44e3-90e8-c53b08875af1-0
00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:12.820
Correct.

7148e814-44fe-43c0-a36b-35056a9c4151-0
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:28.690
Knowing that you do SAT prints
would.

2ae5274b-ff3a-46b5-b64e-4fec926be5d6-0
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.190
Having a similar thing for SAT's
be beneficial or.

6c4482fb-93da-4f87-922d-4e7e317c0f99-0
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.140
Say that more time. I'm so
sorry.

fa135a2f-e4f1-42d2-9d96-4b9142c5901c-0
00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:39.860
So.

8465193a-ad4e-4022-ab51-ea85f9199bc2-0
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:45.669
Through the automation when
creating SCT, would creating a

8465193a-ad4e-4022-ab51-ea85f9199bc2-1
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:50.976
PDF for the SCT to be printed
off at a later time to put into

8465193a-ad4e-4022-ab51-ea85f9199bc2-2
00:25:50.976 --> 00:25:55.940
the customer portfolio or
whatever? Would that would that

8465193a-ad4e-4022-ab51-ea85f9199bc2-3
00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.220
be beneficial? Yes, that would
be beneficial too.

118e50c3-3731-4a9a-b383-3efc3c1b3347-0
00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:09.090
What do you need a print out of
the SCT for?

5f47034f-cd10-45c0-9792-1b468efe2259-0
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:14.271
Typically we just make a
profile. I mean, if we're going

5f47034f-cd10-45c0-9792-1b468efe2259-1
00:26:14.271 --> 00:26:15.790
paperless futuristically.

8646bbb4-88d0-4dc9-bf83-f186dda4f151-0
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.320
Umm.

f341a210-97f8-4cc8-b4d0-1f7198fef264-0
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.392
Then I guess we would be in a
good position. It just has that

f341a210-97f8-4cc8-b4d0-1f7198fef264-1
00:26:23.392 --> 00:26:27.115
proof of it's that double check
of all of our design consultants

f341a210-97f8-4cc8-b4d0-1f7198fef264-2
00:26:27.115 --> 00:26:30.839
go through &amp; the sales order
and the production to make sure

f341a210-97f8-4cc8-b4d0-1f7198fef264-3
00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:34.220
we ordered it correctly for an
accountability perspective.

b75ed0be-cb65-4f0d-be8a-6216a43d5b0d-0
00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:35.670
Umm.

6ecc863d-8b31-4332-aa3e-780bd66ce3fa-0
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.870
Versus.

9f64c0f5-6127-4568-aa7b-420b39157790-0
00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.290
Umm.

5abae42b-5832-42eb-8606-cacae3f43663-0
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.896
Versus it just being on blind
faith that we ordered correctly

5abae42b-5832-42eb-8606-cacae3f43663-1
00:26:45.896 --> 00:26:48.240
because sometimes you can catch
error same day.

cce9e3b7-5e45-4fa1-9582-421b35617d9b-0
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:50.810
That would really be the only
purpose.

4e4ced23-65f6-4a23-8b75-3ca31fddff34-0
00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.580
Um.

5afde961-f5aa-487e-9079-755adcd3b8d0-0
00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:05.192
While we're on your wish list,
who who would need these PDF's?

5afde961-f5aa-487e-9079-755adcd3b8d0-1
00:27:05.192 --> 00:27:10.682
So if I were to create the
service, um, either it could be

5afde961-f5aa-487e-9079-755adcd3b8d0-2
00:27:10.682 --> 00:27:16.265
it would be stored in a file
location that anyone or any of

5afde961-f5aa-487e-9079-755adcd3b8d0-3
00:27:16.265 --> 00:27:22.314
the users need to get to so they
can see it there. It could also

5afde961-f5aa-487e-9079-755adcd3b8d0-4
00:27:22.314 --> 00:27:25.850
be attached to an e-mail for
whoever.

ceb688f2-974c-48e0-b306-ae1503b77f6f-0
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.110
To needs to receive that could
see it.

d4377fa1-e6a5-4554-96cd-a8149cf7fe0f-0
00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.790
So who who are these people that
would need?

a3db20ff-9b7b-46b0-9c3e-c09d012c13a4-0
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.830
These PDFs.

1f3bd482-9796-4960-ac95-1b8eb964bbf9-0
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:43.230
I would say it would be store
manager. Assistant manager in

1f3bd482-9796-4960-ac95-1b8eb964bbf9-1
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.450
store support would be your 3.

1c30e9d2-45cf-427e-95a6-d9bafc614dca-0
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:51.270
Levels of leadership that would
need it.

fec11190-548d-4a90-a23a-03527422abad-0
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.720
Store support would only be if
they're backfilling for.

d69d5657-6562-4ebc-ae77-c5058a2f4ef9-0
00:27:56.550 --> 00:28:00.337
A store remotely, but store
managers and assistant managers

d69d5657-6562-4ebc-ae77-c5058a2f4ef9-1
00:28:00.337 --> 00:28:02.800
per store would be the most
important.

583e382b-73c2-48fc-ad18-545ae5a5960b-0
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:06.310
OK.

73b3395f-f6f2-4c43-b4e0-11c40d00d116-0
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.820
Benessere anyone else you think
there should have access to

73b3395f-f6f2-4c43-b4e0-11c40d00d116-1
00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.030
that?

31495a08-6301-4b7f-94b8-5a08134e1f3f-0
00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.060
No, I would just put an impulse.

2a7189cc-41e5-49c9-b17b-4a334bccc2e4-0
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.550
Whoever has access has access.

d9456cef-727d-407e-b7ee-32e06a666187-0
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.608
Um, we only use impulse for RMA,
so would that be something we

d9456cef-727d-407e-b7ee-32e06a666187-1
00:28:29.608 --> 00:28:33.325
could be taught how to pull
something out of in files to

d9456cef-727d-407e-b7ee-32e06a666187-2
00:28:33.325 --> 00:28:34.890
attach to an e-mail? OK.

c23afa01-ac09-45ab-b3bf-62a9f5ccca5e-0
00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:37.270
Perfect.

a9981d8e-3010-4310-bd85-bf67a2292f8e-0
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.780
Any um edge cases for.

023b727b-7255-481e-aa40-458f6c7a07ce-0
00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.430
Back order review any what I'm
sorry.

85747115-330a-45db-8401-0ae0dc46e833-0
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.690
Edge cases, so just like things
that.

55da1ce6-53b5-4231-b711-f6c992e0b675-0
00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:18.184
Need to be considered when
processing back orders? Or is

55da1ce6-53b5-4231-b711-f6c992e0b675-1
00:29:18.184 --> 00:29:22.339
would that not be within scope?
I think the only other edge case

55da1ce6-53b5-4231-b711-f6c992e0b675-2
00:29:22.339 --> 00:29:25.920
would actually be what's up on
the screen, so the SC-1.

629e2fe0-907a-4673-bf1c-31e3b482f6f4-0
00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.750
Those would be the ones that we
called out. Would need to be on

629e2fe0-907a-4673-bf1c-31e3b482f6f4-1
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.640
that exception list or the error
list.

0834c5a1-6735-4042-af2a-eccf7cc5bb37-0
00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:32.940
Because we haven't.

ecb88ba0-8afc-489a-b601-f95a49bdd86d-0
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.350
Um.

3e42451d-b781-4a7f-b4c5-16f769fdb458-0
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:40.098
It's a customization scheme that
we're having to create through

3e42451d-b781-4a7f-b4c5-16f769fdb458-1
00:29:40.098 --> 00:29:42.180
IT that's not in our system.

e9797009-57fa-4d29-9b91-ece7ebc8ba92-0
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:49.980
So it could be SC1, dash or fill
in or I'm sorry, SC1 or fill in.

7114b741-d14a-4037-bb4b-a9e7f2d9ce25-0
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.902
Skew Justin that's not set up as
transfer supplied and also does

7114b741-d14a-4037-bb4b-a9e7f2d9ce25-1
00:29:55.902 --> 00:30:00.071
not have a supplier so it would
error out if you tried to do

7114b741-d14a-4037-bb4b-a9e7f2d9ce25-2
00:30:00.071 --> 00:30:00.550
either.

63ed8c1a-c4f8-44ec-bbae-575ef08689fd-0
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:06.576
So my my thought process would
be since those records aren't

63ed8c1a-c4f8-44ec-bbae-575ef08689fd-1
00:30:06.576 --> 00:30:11.070
there, automation would skip
over those order or at least.

a0c0055e-6ff1-4fe4-a797-4d31ebbfe0c3-0
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:15.550
On first pass reports it can't
do.

5a11bed6-ad9b-44f2-85c6-829a7c3cd8d7-0
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:20.700
The automation because records
aren't there. And then once that

5a11bed6-ad9b-44f2-85c6-829a7c3cd8d7-1
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:24.595
stock code is created, the
automation should be able to

5a11bed6-ad9b-44f2-85c6-829a7c3cd8d7-2
00:30:24.595 --> 00:30:25.359
pick it up.

8225eba7-f50b-49f7-9750-07e8dbaed3b5-0
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:32.549
Is that makes sense to everyone,
so we would skip the order as a

8225eba7-f50b-49f7-9750-07e8dbaed3b5-1
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:38.255
whole, right? It would tip that
process and then part of the

8225eba7-f50b-49f7-9750-07e8dbaed3b5-2
00:30:38.255 --> 00:30:43.586
error reporting just report
saying, hey, this stock code

8225eba7-f50b-49f7-9750-07e8dbaed3b5-3
00:30:43.586 --> 00:30:48.637
does not have sufficient
information to get an SCT or

8225eba7-f50b-49f7-9750-07e8dbaed3b5-4
00:30:48.637 --> 00:30:50.040
purchase order.

b5a36069-ae8b-4fde-82eb-b2fbe0e3e08b-0
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:52.600
Rated 4.

df566600-860a-40ab-8098-6033020aeab5-0
00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.800
But so it would do.

2e16607c-aa9c-4b94-9b48-0e0a1e911e83-0
00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:01.337
For everything else on the order
it would process through, just

2e16607c-aa9c-4b94-9b48-0e0a1e911e83-1
00:31:01.337 --> 00:31:02.860
not that one line item or.

1f42d56c-e2f9-47b2-8830-e9e311090e5c-0
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.777
We've already defined that for
the order, everything must be

1f42d56c-e2f9-47b2-8830-e9e311090e5c-1
00:31:08.777 --> 00:31:13.314
fulfilled at the time, and then
if one of the items can't be

1f42d56c-e2f9-47b2-8830-e9e311090e5c-2
00:31:13.314 --> 00:31:16.810
fulfilled, the whole order won't
be processed.

9f2e03d7-c52b-457d-a0a3-ca617a47c737-0
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.625
I think that's the cleanest. I
just wanted to make sure I was

9f2e03d7-c52b-457d-a0a3-ca617a47c737-1
00:31:25.625 --> 00:31:27.030
clear on what would happen.

cdd13cbf-6f6a-4e8b-980b-aaeaf6c505e3-0
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.810
Create a nightmare otherwise,
right then.

35154e7d-5605-4797-ae0d-e15d86e2d461-0
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:46.388
Yeah, I see the vendors that are
special order vendors and I have

35154e7d-5605-4797-ae0d-e15d86e2d461-1
00:31:46.388 --> 00:31:50.176
two others. I've just gotta my
brain is blinking right now and

35154e7d-5605-4797-ae0d-e15d86e2d461-2
00:31:50.176 --> 00:31:51.739
what the other two are so.

12aff6e1-d759-413e-9623-486369073c3a-0
00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:55.790
I've gotta go look at the master
list to pull the other two down.

5657da4e-35a1-43b9-9d3f-78b09854ec0e-0
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:57.370
Sure thing.

d803b178-980c-4d5d-bd2a-75e3d76835ab-0
00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.699
Well, it wouldn't really matter
because it would be based off

d803b178-980c-4d5d-bd2a-75e3d76835ab-1
00:32:01.699 --> 00:32:02.200
the line.

bb032b1f-c60e-42c8-84e5-42ef1b909194-0
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:04.490
That flag at the bottom level.

8cdbc233-69fd-4520-97ec-2a5c04dae781-0
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:05.790
Correct.

743ba3a2-edab-4ea4-baf3-6ea9129bf78a-0
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:10.410
I don't think it was a hard hard
code any vendors into.

ff70f6e9-0a96-4168-8cab-1f3e14c047c5-0
00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:17.409
So the the new Ecat will send
over whether or not that item

ff70f6e9-0a96-4168-8cab-1f3e14c047c5-1
00:32:17.409 --> 00:32:23.083
can be special ordered. There's
gonna be no other catch that is

ff70f6e9-0a96-4168-8cab-1f3e14c047c5-2
00:32:23.083 --> 00:32:23.970
needed to.

b727767e-c79c-4d1d-a0f9-2b9ad1574197-0
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:30.245
Specify whether an item can be
automated per say. Correct.

b727767e-c79c-4d1d-a0f9-2b9ad1574197-1
00:32:30.245 --> 00:32:31.910
Correct. Yeah, OK.

5047ac35-d669-41e6-8c98-487ab03cb442-0
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:38.760
Any.

7d6fad7c-ef66-4f10-9be1-a36efbd28a71-0
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.020
Any other tidbits?

6074b663-1ae9-4ec6-a008-52ed116352bb-0
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:48.560
Don't think so.

0452c948-d35a-4ca8-8657-575599f9a086-0
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.260
OK, um.

57ffbcb8-509b-4b8c-b9e6-9fe1dc3ee9b4-0
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:58.170
Just gonna go through the
current functional requirement

57ffbcb8-509b-4b8c-b9e6-9fe1dc3ee9b4-1
00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:02.107
document and um, if you can
answer some of these questions,

57ffbcb8-509b-4b8c-b9e6-9fe1dc3ee9b4-2
00:33:02.107 --> 00:33:06.241
that'd be great. If not, try to
figure out another time to get

57ffbcb8-509b-4b8c-b9e6-9fe1dc3ee9b4-3
00:33:06.241 --> 00:33:07.160
those answers.

039558d3-169e-4bd6-b4eb-015d57ad7a00-0
00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:09.300
Space.

4a248a4a-3087-439c-8add-e6e0c869ab29-0
00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.210
Say that again, I said. Which
page? May I answer?

a66b31c3-b96b-4767-93fd-dc0de47ddf34-0
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:21.933
Ohh um I have it on my computer
so page 5 uh so I work from

a66b31c3-b96b-4767-93fd-dc0de47ddf34-1
00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:23.250
SharePoint.

ad4bf298-553b-4ad4-9097-f5bee5aee587-0
00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:28.964
So if you're looking at are you
are you're OK, let me go to that

ad4bf298-553b-4ad4-9097-f5bee5aee587-1
00:33:28.964 --> 00:33:33.517
document. Hold on. OK, I have it
printed in front of me, so let

ad4bf298-553b-4ad4-9097-f5bee5aee587-2
00:33:33.517 --> 00:33:36.790
me right. I didn't want to start
talking and.

70197a65-5be8-4b5d-bf01-0c65212f70a2-0
00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.400
See what I'm looking at?

45718d26-f239-44ec-93b9-6725e0dec8a6-0
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:41.450
OK.

fdd2ec92-682d-43a6-81f1-25c9673b03d2-0
00:33:48.800 --> 00:34:01.490


be2442f0-e624-4a7a-bb8d-064ac5b89315-0
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.150
Party. I'm here.

75d4fc98-0763-4bff-9285-4c4fea5f2558-0
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.964
If you, uh, starting just at
Section 3. Understanding the

75d4fc98-0763-4bff-9285-4c4fea5f2558-1
00:34:21.964 --> 00:34:26.487
user environment, uh who? Who
are these users that will

75d4fc98-0763-4bff-9285-4c4fea5f2558-2
00:34:26.487 --> 00:34:28.830
benefit from this automation?

a7e4d354-e60b-4993-a13a-e7cb644208d9-0
00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:33.940
Um, store manager? Assistant
manager.

78d2a557-2c24-4c4e-b1a9-5b7eed6470be-0
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.310
Design consultants and store
support.

d2f7cd84-c382-42fb-bc3c-7d4021f40471-0
00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:48.990
OK.

0bd76d4f-dc02-423c-a12e-20a9c75c0282-0
00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:51.050
I'll fill those in.

95c64fb7-a57d-40d3-afd2-21edce03955b-0
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.244
You want me to type in here as
we're going or no? That would be

95c64fb7-a57d-40d3-afd2-21edce03955b-1
00:34:56.244 --> 00:34:56.820
great. OK.

c4c8740c-4e9d-40f6-97a6-a649aec5c09d-0
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.440
Sorry, I didn't know if you
wanted me to type comment or.

cef888c6-ef6c-48ff-9533-836181abc376-0
00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.110
Yeah, you.

3e85f67c-8a1d-46ea-907d-5eca65cbee93-0
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.730
It would be better than me
trying to.

622eb675-57b4-49fe-89fa-6ba21aa33d17-0
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:12.140
I should just put all of retail
just kidding.

b8b8ae26-1bc1-4d9f-aa9d-8b87042618de-0
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.460
Unfortunately, I don't know if
that's a.

637ad033-7f6e-4d02-b143-2d67093a7fcf-0
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:20.930
Specific enough, um.

82244bf5-9ec6-4d97-9543-b3e8de8959da-0
00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:23.010
Let's see.

a9125451-52f3-48d4-988f-80e3c6770d40-0
00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:26.670
OK.

0188d716-8cf5-4156-8cd1-32d1075932fd-0
00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.080
The side.

eb6bd378-4c4a-4da4-8bf1-2905685ec60a-0
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.800
Before we go to the next
section, do these answers look

eb6bd378-4c4a-4da4-8bf1-2905685ec60a-1
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.160
good?

06f87d37-a6fd-46d2-8382-e42230d41086-0
00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:36.840
In your.

c82a1955-67f8-4ce6-a5d0-60f3131fa659-0
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.200
Point of view.

9ea255ab-c278-4528-8b29-4259ce891286-0
00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.850
For the other questions.

443c3041-f2b1-4155-8ce6-8e1397262d6c-0
00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:43.030
Longer.

d3df1f2b-7bbb-4e6d-beff-375b010e2890-0
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:46.300
I think we automated OK.

ddebc46d-eed1-40ba-8e56-eaea3bcb2970-0
00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.150
Expectations are changing.

d7c6a6ef-791c-4947-a707-18a87f5b9161-0
00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:05.840
Define.

e5d7ad44-f2ab-4c92-a599-667298d54bf0-0
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:11.960
I would think that expectations
on training also we would want.

5b96707d-95bb-479a-af91-2d5ddf5675d6-0
00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:18.026
Clearly we want to handle
exceptions, but we'll want to do

5b96707d-95bb-479a-af91-2d5ddf5675d6-1
00:36:18.026 --> 00:36:22.952
a whole training class around
that. And then Margaret, who is

5b96707d-95bb-479a-af91-2d5ddf5675d6-2
00:36:22.952 --> 00:36:23.270
our.

bc70a703-f310-44cf-93aa-07b24b04082a-0
00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:29.461
Operational trainer, go ahead.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I was

bc70a703-f310-44cf-93aa-07b24b04082a-1
00:36:29.461 --> 00:36:33.709
just trying to say I know who
market Margaret is. OK, perfect,

bc70a703-f310-44cf-93aa-07b24b04082a-2
00:36:33.709 --> 00:36:37.756
fantastic. You're like I know
who she is. So Margaret would

bc70a703-f310-44cf-93aa-07b24b04082a-3
00:36:37.756 --> 00:36:41.870
then build out these updates
through designing them. She now

bc70a703-f310-44cf-93aa-07b24b04082a-4
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:45.781
has access, so we Emily has
given her access to build out

bc70a703-f310-44cf-93aa-07b24b04082a-5
00:36:45.781 --> 00:36:47.670
from a training perspective.

e00de0cb-0350-48fa-a030-d1293916f9c7-0
00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:50.400
Um.

b9829b5e-2f05-4753-9d47-108eaf67b944-0
00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:52.300
So.

3f0fcbfc-dae5-44b7-b555-64f64771c803-0
00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.590
Uh.

528011ab-0292-4d6f-89fa-998782457fd5-0
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:11.330
So outside of this, um.

70cd0903-9d23-4cbf-8d11-f44b43d73d43-0
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:16.735
Functional requirement. There
will be a technical document

70cd0903-9d23-4cbf-8d11-f44b43d73d43-1
00:37:16.735 --> 00:37:21.416
outlining the automation that is
set up. Um, is there any other

70cd0903-9d23-4cbf-8d11-f44b43d73d43-2
00:37:21.416 --> 00:37:25.440
desired hard copies or other
documentation that would?

67513058-7a4d-48ad-bbc7-497a996b8621-0
00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.220
Well, have wanted.

08651fb1-d65e-45c1-b5eb-870098213175-0
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:33.523
Forget I'm not sure my screen.
Yes, we'll have to build out the

08651fb1-d65e-45c1-b5eb-870098213175-1
00:37:33.523 --> 00:37:37.511
interface for our operations
document, which Margaret would

08651fb1-d65e-45c1-b5eb-870098213175-2
00:37:37.511 --> 00:37:41.500
handle as well, so operations
manual would be updated with.

15dc652e-727f-4981-aaaa-17775ca64222-0
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.208
Basically slide by slide
picture, like walking them

15dc652e-727f-4981-aaaa-17775ca64222-1
00:37:46.208 --> 00:37:47.750
through the whole piece.

4fa04a80-7a78-4163-8ecd-b85614e45d32-0
00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.790
From start to finish.

c17b2241-7138-4ecb-8eb6-5fac852c9b44-0
00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:03.065
Just trying to envision what
that would look like so with

c17b2241-7138-4ecb-8eb6-5fac852c9b44-1
00:38:03.065 --> 00:38:05.340
this automation ideally.

66543669-78bf-4646-894d-ed7e0623431e-0
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:10.639
No one will have to go through
back order review, it's just to

66543669-78bf-4646-894d-ed7e0623431e-1
00:38:10.639 --> 00:38:12.970
make sure users understand from.

bb2ec9a2-6694-49ab-9c12-ccdca588e782-0
00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.380
Point of order is ready to be.

2e9ab9a3-e3c7-4dca-865f-13fae893d4ea-0
00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:22.883
Automated, which is the order
has been released and that

2e9ab9a3-e3c7-4dca-865f-13fae893d4ea-1
00:38:22.883 --> 00:38:27.897
deposit is visible on retail
orders. Hmm. A system will be

2e9ab9a3-e3c7-4dca-865f-13fae893d4ea-2
00:38:27.897 --> 00:38:33.250
able to pick it up and process
and purchase orders scripts are

2e9ab9a3-e3c7-4dca-865f-13fae893d4ea-3
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:34.779
created right? OK.

be8f0ccf-11f8-402a-8794-1502b258e8f6-0
00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.544
And at the end of the, I mean
the ultimate end game is after

be8f0ccf-11f8-402a-8794-1502b258e8f6-1
00:38:39.544 --> 00:38:43.262
that's all done then to my
understanding is this will flow

be8f0ccf-11f8-402a-8794-1502b258e8f6-2
00:38:43.262 --> 00:38:43.830
to sugar.

45bc781c-d584-42bc-9df2-0f9f59e5de38-0
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:46.840
For um.

bd5ce31b-e976-4636-9be7-4f83baa99d26-0
00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:53.207
This will flow to sugar to give
the status of each line item

bd5ce31b-e976-4636-9be7-4f83baa99d26-1
00:38:53.207 --> 00:38:56.842
like so that we can have a
status report for those

bd5ce31b-e976-4636-9be7-4f83baa99d26-2
00:38:56.842 --> 00:38:58.910
particular customers as well.

5e791665-a754-4f0c-ad65-0cef96c9bf58-0
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:04.557
OK. How does that right now that
currently flows based off of the

5e791665-a754-4f0c-ad65-0cef96c9bf58-1
00:39:04.557 --> 00:39:08.171
SCT, so Megan Frank would of
course have all that information

5e791665-a754-4f0c-ad65-0cef96c9bf58-2
00:39:08.171 --> 00:39:10.270
how we're following that right
now?

96eca535-df25-439e-b36a-a2b8264c0f09-0
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.500
I I work on the sugar export, so
I.

e3c82243-e8ee-4d1b-bed4-a04029724b97-0
00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.256
You kind of know where I'm going
with what all that information

e3c82243-e8ee-4d1b-bed4-a04029724b97-1
00:39:19.256 --> 00:39:20.210
gets floated to.

020c4ab5-75e0-4a36-b1e8-0acb3bf0491f-0
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.670
OK, um, Section 4.

723529c7-f0e6-4dd9-8bc6-4302e96d2d82-0
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.340
Are these answers?

d41474b6-bb96-42cc-80c7-c827b350218c-0
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.350
Goods.

e19fe84e-c86e-48f0-9f82-b85cf49dcac8-0
00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.520
Use this application.

4a9f4e1c-be9c-45be-a064-4cae7e236667-0
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:49.900
Yes.

b23e0ef2-90e1-4498-b479-3ea8d91e2e30-0
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:51.260
OK.

52488f0e-d1be-4e74-beea-6b3a5faf1998-0
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:58.230
Then dropping down to Section 7
OK.

91284c39-c8c9-4212-98f9-b1458843770f-0
00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:00.610
I feel like.

40d382b5-e4a0-45e4-bcf3-f0008f088c68-0
00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:08.326
We've hit on some of these uh
questions. It just hasn't been

40d382b5-e4a0-45e4-bcf3-f0008f088c68-1
00:40:08.326 --> 00:40:13.610
uh typed out in a official
status per se. Um.

baecb70f-ac40-428c-9d8b-65e113ed19db-0
00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.390
So.

80bfd108-5e35-49c0-b578-5cf92f3b59c4-0
00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:22.866
Statpro, we talked about uh
stair store, the warehouse 3 PL.

80bfd108-5e35-49c0-b578-5cf92f3b59c4-1
00:40:22.866 --> 00:40:24.190
or customer.

0807a99e-b082-482d-8577-bd359614479a-0
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:31.259
We noted that there is shipping
terms coming over that should be

0807a99e-b082-482d-8577-bd359614479a-1
00:40:31.259 --> 00:40:35.424
able to map. I don't know if we
can answer it right here, but I

0807a99e-b082-482d-8577-bd359614479a-2
00:40:35.424 --> 00:40:36.010
will get.

cf2fe8a4-9ece-4678-9b36-68acb18e8661-0
00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:42.185
You a thankful list of what
those are and make sure we

cf2fe8a4-9ece-4678-9b36-68acb18e8661-1
00:40:42.185 --> 00:40:46.610
understand which one is which.
Sure, absolutely.

1b2fad0e-35ad-4deb-a77c-ba630efc6e86-0
00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:48.270
Um.

e6e63c97-248c-423e-ba8b-8f98b90469f2-0
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:53.780
So with the this it's.

95061b01-0359-43e8-8e49-f8d3b264b156-0
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:04.920
Whatever.

a499f0d1-c7cd-4812-b9b2-6e35e50efb7d-0
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:09.300
Last financing.

d7a3494e-f2ea-4539-9d07-d102c3f7c560-0
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:22.770
OK.

a4e010ac-4ca9-4e11-bc84-356c976f3943-0
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.970
Um.

9fd8ad40-d304-48d6-ac24-418d0a0dc5cc-0
00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:36.435
The next question um, Ben, I've
looked at the Syspro business

9fd8ad40-d304-48d6-ac24-418d0a0dc5cc-1
00:41:36.435 --> 00:41:41.850
object who creating a purchase
order.

5b7b8329-a28b-402d-82f6-6ce4e0bc961d-0
00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:48.889
I haven't dived into it fully,
but is there needed to have a

5b7b8329-a28b-402d-82f6-6ce4e0bc961d-1
00:41:48.889 --> 00:41:53.907
price designated on that
purchase order for SYSPRO to

5b7b8329-a28b-402d-82f6-6ce4e0bc961d-2
00:41:53.907 --> 00:41:58.090
fully create it through the
business object?

1626e066-cac2-4f19-9d54-39104768dc95-0
00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:06.320
I mean technically, no. You
could create a PO at a 0.

9344cf01-e72d-40e3-8f1d-14b66af9b22a-0
00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:09.120
Price, but I don't think we'd
want to.

a6c0e9b8-5fbf-45da-9918-4db2eea63b35-0
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.418
Because this would never get
fixed, so I think if it doesn't

a6c0e9b8-5fbf-45da-9918-4db2eea63b35-1
00:42:13.418 --> 00:42:13.820
find a.

2ad01eaf-e806-4f7a-91b0-d5b665bbe6df-0
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:20.750
Matching contract price then
we'd wanted to hear out. OK, so.

9898e456-63e6-4121-9e57-84a5dafe124a-0
00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:27.202
Back to you, Alissa. What just
specific details on what price

9898e456-63e6-4121-9e57-84a5dafe124a-1
00:42:27.202 --> 00:42:29.350
to pick out of the system?

3915867a-d6b6-487d-a2ae-19536ef2b683-0
00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:37.350
It's going to. Each vendor is
different. That's the problem.

aad761ec-bfee-45cf-b655-acd913a02834-0
00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:45.899
But should probably need to go
and look at. I can't remember

aad761ec-bfee-45cf-b655-acd913a02834-1
00:42:45.899 --> 00:42:46.630
all of the.

db0aabb7-c0c2-4a77-ac39-fb36e1dd4a92-0
00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:51.761
I need to go look at it, so I
apologize. I don't I'd have to

db0aabb7-c0c2-4a77-ac39-fb36e1dd4a92-1
00:42:51.761 --> 00:42:54.780
answer that question next unless
Ben can give me a.

0402c65b-e713-4584-90e2-78c66d5dd91f-0
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:59.889
Well, my assumption would be it
would be, you know, based off

0402c65b-e713-4584-90e2-78c66d5dd91f-1
00:42:59.889 --> 00:43:03.110
the contract prices you have to
not be expired.

d93d9203-4013-4a2c-aeea-f042938642cd-0
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.970
And.

f9c97478-11ce-4237-a6db-7b5713b38923-0
00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:10.889
The order quantity would have to
meet the minimum quantity of the

f9c97478-11ce-4237-a6db-7b5713b38923-1
00:43:10.889 --> 00:43:11.560
PR price.

ad3724e9-088d-44bf-8949-51cd88b15926-0
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:16.649
And then if you have multiples
that meet that criteria, assume

ad3724e9-088d-44bf-8949-51cd88b15926-1
00:43:16.649 --> 00:43:19.350
we would want to always take the
lowest price.

dd221ce2-3cc5-4875-b0cc-df9b5b013964-0
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:22.830
Yes, that's, that's accurate,
yes.

36642665-e166-4a9c-977b-05a580443b05-0
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.520
OK.

e9a4f806-a041-40f0-8518-00d6771b8059-0
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.276
OK, when items are added to the
order after the initially

e9a4f806-a041-40f0-8518-00d6771b8059-1
00:43:37.276 --> 00:43:38.950
processed, should these be?

738cea86-9632-4a0a-8694-c3f428b6cbbd-0
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.610
So my first assumption would be.

128dd60a-bb7e-4195-a231-321b8ba306e7-0
00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:52.276
There's two ways of automation
could see an order. One it's

128dd60a-bb7e-4195-a231-321b8ba306e7-1
00:43:52.276 --> 00:43:57.058
been initially released,
automation should be able to see

128dd60a-bb7e-4195-a231-321b8ba306e7-2
00:43:57.058 --> 00:43:59.119
that and then process it.

1404c2f7-3df2-4f1a-8038-de831ed21d18-0
00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:05.128
Something that else the
automation can see is definitely

1404c2f7-3df2-4f1a-8038-de831ed21d18-1
00:44:05.128 --> 00:44:09.939
when a new item has been added
and put into the back order

1404c2f7-3df2-4f1a-8038-de831ed21d18-2
00:44:09.939 --> 00:44:10.510
status.

41be1424-3785-4343-b9ad-10243ecc4dad-0
00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:18.312
The question would be then, uh,
Ben, would the new feel to

41be1424-3785-4343-b9ad-10243ecc4dad-1
00:44:18.312 --> 00:44:24.019
special order said back order
item be available to users to

41be1424-3785-4343-b9ad-10243ecc4dad-2
00:44:24.019 --> 00:44:29.726
designate, yeah, OK, so then
yeah, the automation should be

41be1424-3785-4343-b9ad-10243ecc4dad-3
00:44:29.726 --> 00:44:35.719
able to pick up new orders and
then back order items on orders

41be1424-3785-4343-b9ad-10243ecc4dad-4
00:44:35.719 --> 00:44:41.902
that already exist and possibly
have already been processed. OK,

41be1424-3785-4343-b9ad-10243ecc4dad-5
00:44:41.902 --> 00:44:43.710
so the question is.

3f824648-e57c-4cbd-9c0d-d5fbe4429884-0
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:48.890
Does the business process want
that to be allowed?

daf7d13a-5b7a-4371-918a-af80f8d83946-0
00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:56.720
I would think yes, unless then
you told me no.

b303d46b-02f6-4824-988a-9e9cf7b21371-0
00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.925
Um, yeah, it would. Just you'd
have to put it on a new PO or

b303d46b-02f6-4824-988a-9e9cf7b21371-1
00:45:02.925 --> 00:45:03.430
new SCT.

b0afb714-e9db-4bdd-ad8a-c759e0c135d5-0
00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:04.740
OK.

658cefbe-468a-46a2-b8fa-e5b9d430f92d-0
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:10.920
Because I don't think we want to
go.

70e3bf15-cef7-46da-978e-03f93955ad61-0
00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:15.900
Add it to one that's might have
been submitted 3 weeks ago.

d3e6e04a-2070-4142-9e12-d7d372703819-0
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:22.111
Is there not any indicator on
the SCT to know whether or not

d3e6e04a-2070-4142-9e12-d7d372703819-1
00:45:22.111 --> 00:45:24.350
we could add more items to that
SCT?

8aa1f49a-b3de-4a54-8e22-8b46c7045aee-0
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:27.430
Umm.

0382fb4d-e2d4-49da-a29c-0da4bda18a00-0
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:32.124
It would delay the production
schedule. Is that correct? Is

0382fb4d-e2d4-49da-a29c-0da4bda18a00-1
00:45:32.124 --> 00:45:34.380
that mess up Scott in them in
the back?

f97c1684-aa5a-4146-9db1-7b68c4f31cf0-0
00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:40.870
Umm.

cf874185-55c9-4d79-9773-2ba0dc03422e-0
00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:49.190
Because I'm not going to say it
doesn't not happen properly so.

ffcac730-bf0d-4baf-b08f-8e03ebfeba80-0
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:51.280
Theory.

0bb7ee27-0406-4433-ab28-e2ceb4b56b60-0
00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:54.310
Yeah, I'd be less worried about
an SCT.

c17d4fa3-eda7-4032-a979-e354f64b056a-0
00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.728
We could add it to an SCT that's
already in the system. You're

c17d4fa3-eda7-4032-a979-e354f64b056a-1
00:45:58.728 --> 00:46:01.830
just going to essentially jump
in front of anybody that.

0d0d5caa-00d0-461f-b0c0-6bf9c4ff3778-0
00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:06.545
Like if I add something to an
SCT from two months ago, I'm

0d0d5caa-00d0-461f-b0c0-6bf9c4ff3778-1
00:46:06.545 --> 00:46:10.280
jumping in front of two months
worth of customers. Yeah.

51b34abc-31f4-4d6e-bc0d-9273e73eece9-0
00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:16.068
Whether that matters or not,
other than that it does mess up

51b34abc-31f4-4d6e-bc0d-9273e73eece9-1
00:46:16.068 --> 00:46:20.570
some of our kind of like level
of service reporting on saying.

e4d7bbbc-191d-4cec-9ad6-2d7794032692-0
00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:26.010
Well, I entered the order on
January 1st and you can make the

e4d7bbbc-191d-4cec-9ad6-2d7794032692-1
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:30.091
cushions till April 15th. Well,
if that item was added to the

e4d7bbbc-191d-4cec-9ad6-2d7794032692-2
00:46:30.091 --> 00:46:34.105
order April 1st, it's kind of a
unfair penalty. So I kind of

e4d7bbbc-191d-4cec-9ad6-2d7794032692-3
00:46:34.105 --> 00:46:36.870
would lean towards we should
just always.

9ce0309e-e263-46ed-aa53-7de6722d6fa1-0
00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:42.360
Create a new SCT or a new PO
just to keep things clean.

b50afaaf-bd1f-4159-8e51-aacf08f41397-0
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:49.710
Simpler on my part for sure,
yeah.

a4e6a497-b102-4a47-860b-a41e3910609b-0
00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.440
OK, so then yes, let's go that
route.

141ff221-ef33-4d42-a3c7-4870faa45380-0
00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:26.620


9425f4f1-d2d1-4032-abc6-70fb33c56848-0
00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:34.704
Unless I've been do you have any
other lingering questions for

9425f4f1-d2d1-4032-abc6-70fb33c56848-1
00:47:34.704 --> 00:47:35.490
this project?

54f48850-1af0-4a91-bbbc-71bc9e47a5ab-0
00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:43.689
I'm sure I'm going to have a ton
as we go through this, but as of

54f48850-1af0-4a91-bbbc-71bc9e47a5ab-1
00:47:43.689 --> 00:47:46.230
right now off the top of my head
though.

db6dfa39-cb3a-4da0-9931-2c0844d7d2d1-0
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:53.879
Ever. Whenever one of those come
up, feel free to, uh, ask me or

db6dfa39-cb3a-4da0-9931-2c0844d7d2d1-1
00:47:53.879 --> 00:47:58.150
Ben. Yep, and we'll get back
with y'all, OK.

fe830b89-0f66-4d93-93b0-feae9ab9d61a-0
00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:04.607
So what is the net? I see we
have dates and timelines next.

fe830b89-0f66-4d93-93b0-feae9ab9d61a-1
00:48:04.607 --> 00:48:09.551
So what is next steps that we
need to help with or what

fe830b89-0f66-4d93-93b0-feae9ab9d61a-2
00:48:09.551 --> 00:48:14.760
expectations do you expect out
of us so from this meeting?

0ca7820c-535c-40e4-9dc7-bc3942879db9-0
00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:19.300
I should be able to build out
the rest of the current state.

e15527e7-ad14-4c77-871c-7920850771f9-0
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:24.830
Sean said to get with.

c2d16154-50ae-4416-b4d9-b73f14ee60c1-0
00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:34.320
Certain people on UM confirming
that this is all good. Um.

b45e9c6d-4fc0-4d3f-bbf3-a7f48073b1e4-0
00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:37.770
Think that with clay and someone
in accounting.

fc11915d-da02-477f-b8a9-273ea8723c78-0
00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:42.414
Or traffic and accounting or
somebody, we had two different

fc11915d-da02-477f-b8a9-273ea8723c78-1
00:48:42.414 --> 00:48:43.030
people so.

b45179aa-38d5-468d-858f-9dae1f606d57-0
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:49.387
At least having a meeting with
them once I get this functional

b45179aa-38d5-468d-858f-9dae1f606d57-1
00:48:49.387 --> 00:48:53.390
requirement document. Um. At a
more solid-state, um.

c83bcef3-4781-4724-9e7f-7df2d876e88b-0
00:48:55.490 --> 00:49:01.260
Get that done and then just sign
off from whoever. Uh.

5a3fe242-1923-4e1d-b8c3-2e9a2a6c9f3e-0
00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.620
Once the responsibility is
signed off on this, I guess. Um.

8bf231bb-e8e4-4e35-b5d3-25b232f356a1-0
00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:11.936
Alyssa do you? Would it be you
or would it be someone else? Um,

8bf231bb-e8e4-4e35-b5d3-25b232f356a1-1
00:49:11.936 --> 00:49:16.030
it either be myself or Sean,
just depending on the work.

9e468a89-8917-45e2-8d9c-5d3c6da63ddb-0
00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:21.694
I the only reason why I say that
is middle of March I go out on

9e468a89-8917-45e2-8d9c-5d3c6da63ddb-1
00:49:21.694 --> 00:49:25.668
maternity leave, so it would
just be that timeline of and

9e468a89-8917-45e2-8d9c-5d3c6da63ddb-2
00:49:25.668 --> 00:49:29.504
he's my second in command to
make sure everything rolls

9e468a89-8917-45e2-8d9c-5d3c6da63ddb-3
00:49:29.504 --> 00:49:33.410
correctly. So it'd be either one
of us that can do that.

e48583ad-0995-4575-a161-3bcf6697ccc1-0
00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:35.760
OK, um.

c5efd248-2eee-4809-933a-ede5c6750286-0
00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:42.170
So I'm already, uh, working on
putting together, uh, technical

c5efd248-2eee-4809-933a-ede5c6750286-1
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:46.352
specifications for this. It is
actually gonna. This is

c5efd248-2eee-4809-933a-ede5c6750286-2
00:49:46.352 --> 00:49:51.066
technical information that you
probably won't care about, but

c5efd248-2eee-4809-933a-ede5c6750286-3
00:49:51.066 --> 00:49:55.933
there's already a service that
the service would be modified to

c5efd248-2eee-4809-933a-ede5c6750286-4
00:49:55.933 --> 00:49:57.530
pick up this process.

df18cc9e-9923-4d9b-9bd3-92a9e7db6aea-0
00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:04.020
So I'll be working on those
modifications.

c622edc2-2ace-469e-b01f-62f4c45e0fd4-0
00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:11.424
Within a week or two, um, then
once we'll be in development

c622edc2-2ace-469e-b01f-62f4c45e0fd4-1
00:50:11.424 --> 00:50:11.870
and.

67fa7bcf-37c7-4d5c-b8ff-19b411b6712d-0
00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:18.909
I estimate in March we should be
able to get into uh UAT testing

67fa7bcf-37c7-4d5c-b8ff-19b411b6712d-1
00:50:18.909 --> 00:50:24.310
and preparation for deployment
as long as everything is.

6b2f000a-4a43-4858-ac36-a530e84b25c1-0
00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.530
Kosher. OK, awesome.

f4354a37-bb81-48f3-8981-4e80c308954b-0
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:34.607
Is that timeline estimates good
with you? I know you'll be out

f4354a37-bb81-48f3-8981-4e80c308954b-1
00:50:34.607 --> 00:50:38.881
on the return to you. I'll be
out, but Sean will be leading

f4354a37-bb81-48f3-8981-4e80c308954b-2
00:50:38.881 --> 00:50:43.368
the project at that point. So
yes, him and I, he's on vacation

f4354a37-bb81-48f3-8981-4e80c308954b-3
00:50:43.368 --> 00:50:47.856
this week, so he'll be back in
these meetings as we start back

f4354a37-bb81-48f3-8981-4e80c308954b-4
00:50:47.856 --> 00:50:48.070

b1afc2ed-a8a5-40f6-b5ae-17942637d52c-0
00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.710
Great. Uh.

bf397e2f-2820-491c-8549-f258db3e5536-0
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:57.020
The marketing or accounting and
traffic meeting, wait until Sean

bf397e2f-2820-491c-8549-f258db3e5536-1
00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:01.216

00:51:01.216 --> 00:51:05.411
we could do that next week, that
would be perfect. OK, I'll try

bf397e2f-2820-491c-8549-f258db3e5536-3
00:51:05.411 --> 00:51:08.229

Awesome. Anything else you need

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:17.709
I don't think so. I appreciate
it. I'm sorry I was 7 minutes

686d3b37-5e4c-4058-8a31-39617d0eb0eb-1
00:51:17.709 --> 00:51:18.580

40bbc603-4247-42f3-b079-bbbc9484d2fa-0
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:22.800
Ben was probably like, I'm about
to log off. She's here.

1d9c9283-f2fc-4ca5-ac47-403e31f4ffcc-0
00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:28.733

this time with me walking it

1d9c9283-f2fc-4ca5-ac47-403e31f4ffcc-1

it tremendously if I can get

1d9c9283-f2fc-4ca5-ac47-403e31f4ffcc-2

1d9c9283-f2fc-4ca5-ac47-403e31f4ffcc-3

1d9c9283-f2fc-4ca5-ac47-403e31f4ffcc-5
