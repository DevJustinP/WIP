Authority Token:
    before a call to sugarcrm can be made, an Authority token must be attained.
    The following call grants a token.

    endpoint: https://<site_url>/rest/<version>/oauth2/token 
    pay load: 
    {
        "grant_type":"password", 
        "client_id":"sugar", 
        "client_secret":"", 
        "username":"<username>", 
        "password":"<password>", 
        "platform":"base" 
    }

    grant_type - string type of request. Can be "password" or "refresh_token"
    client_id - string Used to identify the client. A client_id of "sugar" will automatically create an OAuth Key in the system that is used for "password" authentication. A client_id of "support_portal" will create an OAuth Key that will allow for portal authentication. Additional client_id's can be created by the administrator in Admin > OAuth Keys to allow for additional grant types. If the client secret is populated, it will be validated against the client id.
    cleint_secret - string client string
    username - string username for authenticating
    password - string plaintext password for authentication 
    platform - string platform type. Can be "base", "mobile", and "portal"

    expected return:
    {
        "access_token": "5ee48ec7-023e-ecff-5184-530bd0358868",
        "expires_in": 3600,
        "token_type": "bearer",
        "scope": null,
        "refresh_token": "5f197357-0167-f7a6-7912-530bd03275b6",
        "refresh_expires_in": 1209600,
        "download_token": "5f531625-e301-e3ea-1b11-530bd098be41"
    }

    access_token - string access token needed for other methods
    expires_in - integer seconds till toke expires_in
    token_type - string type, currently only "bearer" is supported
    scope - string scope of Oauth
    refresh_token - string token needed to extend the access_token expiration timeout
    refresh_expires_in - integer seconds that refresh_token expires 
    download_token - string token used to download images and files

    Once a token has been granted, and based on expires_in and refresh_expires_in the following payload can be used to refresh token
    {
        "grant_type":"refresh_token",
        "refresh_token":"c1be5132-655b-1ca3-fb44-512e36709871",
        "client_id":"sugar",
        "client_secret":"",
        "platform":"base"
    }

    NOTE: the refresh token does not work as it says it works. It will return an entirely new access_token and refresh_token to use. 
        Though testing suggests that the refresh_token works as inteneded and can be used until the original refresh_expires_in expires.
